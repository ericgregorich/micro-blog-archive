			 <p>I just finished (for now) updating my <a href="https://ericgregorich.com">Micro.blog website</a> theme. I tweaked the colors, fonts, and header. Added a Surprise link that loads a random post and the Bookshelf that shows books I’m reading and interested in. Also, experimenting with the Newsletter feature.</p>

			 <p>I was listening to this episode of <a href="https://www.rework.fm/good-enough-is-fine/">The Rework Podcast</a> by the guys at 37signals. It was a great reminder that we tend to overcomplicate things when building technical solutions. Sometimes, we do it for the challenge, and as developers, it’s fun. Often we miss the point. What’s the end goal?</p>
<p>For example, I was just working with a customer who wanted us to update our existing application to allow batching records together based on complicated logic. We spent hours thinking of a solution. Then someone asked, why do they need this? Oh, so one admin can run a report that shows all the records in a batch. Can’t we add a checkbox to allow the admin to select which records they want to include in the report? Yes! Well, that makes things much easier!</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Cognitive scripts are based on the semantic memory, or the knowledge we acquire throughout our lives. Semantic memory develops when we experience events in the everyday world, such as how to travel by public transport or the steps involved in eating in a restaurant. We organise our experiences into cognitive scripts that are personal to us, and these scripts may vary depending on our perception of a situation and the cultures we identify with. - Dr. Hannah England</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We can overwrite our cognitive scripts by journaling, reset the scripts that don’t work for us, and go off script and take risks.</p>
<p>Cognitive scripts are based on our beliefs, created during our lifetime. Habits are more about the actions we take.</p>

<h2 id="limitations">Limitations</h2>
<ul>
<li>This approach only manipulates the command bar in the current view. You would need to apply the same logic to every view independently. This means you can have different commands appear depending on your view.</li>
<li>This approach is not a substitute for permissions. For example, if you do not want users uploading documents, you should give them Read Only access to the library, not just hide the Upload button. </li>
<li>Some commands appear when one or more documents are selected. Your JSON can specify if the command should be affected depending on the current selection mode. Read more <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sharepoint/dev/declarative-customization/view-commandbar-formatting#selectionmodes%20%22https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sharepoint/dev/declarative-customization/view-commandbar-formatting#selectionmodes">here</a>.</li>
<li>Some commands, such as the Submit for Approval command, cannot be hidden.</li>
<li>You are hiding these commands from everyone. If any specific users need to make changes using the toolbar, they may need to remove this formatting to be able to access the commands they need.</li>

<p>People can be cruel, ungrateful, arrogant, etc., but this does not affect me.</p>
<ol>
<li>Stop being persuaded by impulses. Your mind and body and simple and don&rsquo;t need extravagance.</li>
<li>Nature will always change to do what is best for nature. You are part of nature. Trust the change.</li>
<li>You have limited time in this world. Don&rsquo;t spend it procrastinating on things of importance.</li>
<li>Focus on things as if it was the last thing you will do in life.</li>
<li>You have one life, and it&rsquo;s almost over.</li>
<li>Take the time to learn things for yourself and less for others.</li>
<li>Listen to your heart, and find your happiness.</li>
<li>No one can prevent you from being in harmony with nature.</li>
<li>Sinning out of desire is worse than doing so out of anger. Passion comes from within, and anger is caused by something external.</li>
<li>Death happens to both good and bad people; therefore, how could it be a bad thing? How could death be a punishment for people who are good all their lives?</li>
<li>Objects are temporary and meaningless.</li>
<li>People deserve our affection because they are like us people.</li>
<li>You cannot lose the future or the past, only the present.</li>
<li>&ldquo;Everything is just an impression&rdquo; - Monimus the Cynic</li>
<li>The soul degrades when it becomes upset with things that happen, you turn your back on another when you experience too much pleasure or pain, when you act false, and when your actions are without purpose.</li>
<li>Be true to yourself without depending on others. You can&rsquo;t control nature, perception, the nature of the body, and the soul.</li>

			 <p>While over the past decade, “Productivity” books try to teach you how to be productive and get things done, “I Didn’t Do The Thing Today” jumps on the recent “Anti-productivity” bandwagon and reminds us that to be genuinely productive, we need to relax, rest, and embrace the unexpected.</p>
<p><a href="https://micro.blog/books/9780593419144" title="I Didn’t Do The Thing Today by Madeleine Dore">I Didn’t Do The Thing Today by Madeleine Dore</a></p>
<p><strong>Key Ideas</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>We can’t compare how productive we are to others because we all have unique circumstances and objectives.</li>
<li>The unexpected and unplanned are often the best part of our days, yet we consider it a “bad day” when things don’t go as planned. Our routines and schedules should guide us but not induce guilt when they are broken.</li>
<li>Preparation, Incubation, Illumination, and Verification are the 4 stages of creativity.</li>
<li>If we determine the things we “could” do and be more flexible with when we do them, perhaps the most important things to use will surface and become part of our day without being forced.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Action Items</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Create a plan for the day to act as a guide.</li>
<li>Keep a list of things I “can” do based on my current time and energy.</li>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>Finished reading: <a href="https://micro.blog/books/9780593135204">Project Hail Mary: A Novel</a> by Andy Weir 📚.</p>
<p>Project Hail Mary is a story by the same author of The Martian, Andy Weir. While The Martian&rsquo;s story is grounded in the science we understand today, Project Hail Mary goes beyond that and adds more sci-fi but does so without breaking the rules of science.<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>The other difference between The Martian and Project Hail Mary is the scope. In The Martian, Mark Watney is stranded on Mars and needs to figure out how to get home. In Project Hail Mary, the Sun is being destroyed by a phenomenon, and Ryland Grace must travel to a distant star to figure out how to save Earth.</p>
<p>The protagonist, Ryland Grace, is a science teacher who ends up as the sole survivor of the Hail Mary as it travels to its destination, where we hope to figure out how to save Earth. Ryland wakes from a coma with no memory of how he got there or even who he is. Fortunately, his memory comes back over time.</p>
<p>As Ryland is solving one problem after another aboard the Hail Mary, his memories slowly return.  We see the planning of the Project Hail Mary mission on Earth and how Ryland was &ldquo;chosen&rdquo; for the mission. We also see the sacrifices that are made to make the mission happen.</p>
<p>The writing is engaging and fun. While there is a lot of math involved, you can get the point without understanding it. It all makes sense. This is one of the special things about Andy Weir&rsquo;s writing style. You can tell he loves this stuff. He spent a lot of time researching and discussing &ldquo;what if&rdquo; scenarios with real scientists and astronauts. After the success of The Martian, he likely has a pool of resources available to him.</p>
<p>This story is not your typical sci-fi. I felt like this could actually happen. Ryland&rsquo;s problems were science-based and felt realistic, opposed to forced plot twists just to make the story exciting. There were many times in this book where I imagined all of the things that could have been done if this were an action sci-fi story that we would typically see. Instead, we get a great story about a guy working out extraordinary problems.</p>
<p>I really enjoyed this book.</p>

<p>By the way, a Project Hail Mary movie is being made, starring Ryan Gosling.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The novelty bias is a form of informal logical fallacy, where we consider that something is better simply because it’s new. Of course, in some cases, novelty seeking does correlate with benefits. For example, a newer computer may offer improved speed and performance. However, not all new ideas and objects will offer benefits over something older or more established.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It’s always easy to see the latest tech innovations (like iPhones) and convince ourselves that we need them. If we think about the pros and cons and let them sit in our minds for a while. We’ll either forget about it or convince ourselves we don’t need it. In rare cases, the new toy improves our life.</p>
