			 <p>In an effort to utilize my iPad mini more for writing and note-taking, I purchased a simple <a href="https://a.co/d/7aSm7eh">keyboard case</a> for it.</p>
<p>The keyboard works well, but I need to slightly scrunch my fingers together, and it takes some getting used to. I also need to learn some keyboard shortcuts.</p>
<p>The keyboard itself attaches magnetically, making it easy to remove from the screen when I want to read. It also has backlighting.</p>
<p>It’s pretty good quality and lightweight overall. Pretty happy with it so far.</p>

			 <p>I discovered in iOS 26 developer beta you can swipe down from the top of the screen in any app to get a full menu bar, just like you would see in macOS.</p>
<p>This is quite handy as it lets you quickly get to hidden settings, features, and see keyboard shortcuts at a glance.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The truth is, other people hold no real power over you unless you give it to them. Here’s why this works: When you stop trying to control things that aren’t yours to control, you stop wasting your energy. You reclaim your time, your peace of mind, and your focus. You realize that your happiness is tied to your actions, not someone else’s behavior, opinions, or mood.&rdquo; (Mel Robbins, The Let Them Theory)</p>

<p>Chevelle has a heavy, melodic sound with deep meaning (that I usually don’t understand), but I love it. The band, which has been around since 1999, is underrated. This would be their 10th studio album, and possibly their final one.</p>
<p>Their first single, Rabbit Hole, is available now.</p>

			 <p>As we age, our bodies change. We lose muscle and mobility, even if we’re healthy.</p>
<p>It creeps up on us, and before we know it, we’re feeling old. Then, it’s much harder or impossible to reverse.</p>
<p>As my 50th birthday approaches, I’ve been more concerned about this.</p>
<p>To combat muscle decay, we must incorporate regular strength and mobility training.</p>
<p>I now have heavy dumbbells, a weight bench, and a simple 30-minute, twice-weekly <a href="https://shop.ganbarumethod.com/products/minimalift-program-bundle">routine</a>.</p>
<p>The most challenging part is incorporating this into my life so that it’s a habit I don’t force myself to do, but feel uncomfortable when I don’t.</p>

<p>Every time I join a new team, I go to the next fresh page, and on top of that page I write: &ldquo;WTF - [Team Name].&rdquo; Then I make a note every time I run into something that makes me go &ldquo;wtf,&rdquo; and a task every time I come up with something I want to change.</p>

<p>A WTF Notebook is a collection of notes that are taken when joining a new team or group. For a couple of weeks, you observe and write down anything that makes you think &ldquo;WTF&rdquo; in your notebook. You are accumulating a list of things that are unusual from your outsider perspective. Later, you can meet with the team or group and review what you noted.</p>

			 <p>I’ve experimented with many e-ink devices over the past few years, hoping to find a device that could help reduce distractions and make it easier to read books and online articles. Some even had note-taking capabilities that I swore would &ldquo;change my life.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Every one of them has failed me (or perhaps I should say, I failed them).</p>
<p>My Journey Through Devices</p>
<p>My first e-ink device was the Amazon Kindle. I don’t remember which version, but I’ve almost always had the most recent Paperwhite. If you&rsquo;re embedded in the Amazon Kindle ecosystem and only read, these Kindles are great. But that’s all they&rsquo;re good for.</p>
<p>My first e-ink note-taking device was the reMarkable 2. I still think this is a great device for taking notes. However, over time, I simply stopped using it. The reading experience was excellent, but getting content onto the device was a challenge. Things may be better in the newer reMarkable Paper Pro, but wow, it’s expensive.</p>
<p>I sold my reMarkable 2 and purchased an iPad Pro, thinking it would solve all my problems. It turned out to be a great device for consuming video, but too bulky for reading books and articles. Note-taking is great, thanks to the diverse app options and the Apple Pencil. Yet, I never used it much for notes. I like handwriting notes but found the iPad Pro simply too bulky.</p>
<p>I again focused on the e-ink world and tried out the Boox Palma. It seemed like a great portable device for reading. I was interested in the Palma because I was traveling a lot at the time, as my daughter was playing travel softball, and the portable size was great. But, my daughter graduated, and the softball trips ended. At home, I slowly stopped using the Palma.</p>
<p>I then briefly went back to the Amazon Kindle. Wanting to break away from Amazon, I tried the Kobo Clara Colour. I was interested in reading graphic novels and comics at the time. The Kobo is a great little device. However, I didn’t have a good way to take notes, and the content selection was slightly limited. Also, I actually found the device too small and limited, similar to the Palma.</p>
<p>Next, I tried the Boox Go Color 7. This device was interesting because it runs full Android, opening up many software options. I was running Kindle, Kobo, Libby, Readwise Reader, and trying out some other apps as well. Overall, it’s a pretty good device, but something was still missing.</p>
<p>I recently purchased the latest Apple iPad Mini with the A17 Pro chip. So far, it checks most of the boxes.</p>
<p>What Do I Really Need?</p>
<p>If I spend some time reflecting on what I really want and need from this device, I realize I need to dig deeper into my expectations and compare them with reality.</p>
<p>What I &ldquo;wanted&rdquo; was an all-in-one device where I could take all my notes, read and watch all my content, and avoid distractions. I was expecting to transform my digital life into something closer to analog.</p>
<p>In reality, I find I don’t take a lot of notes. What works for me is jotting down tasks and notes throughout the day on a piece of paper. Today, I’m using the Apple Notes app for this on the iPad. The ability to tap my lock screen with the Pencil and start writing in today’s note is enough. I’ve also been using Apple Notes to capture miscellaneous notes, receipts, documents, journal-type entries, etc. I even have several notes shared with my family, which is quite handy.</p>
<p>As far as reading, I’m pushing myself to read more books. I have purchased many physical books over the past couple of years and find them the best reading experience. Yet, reading on the iPad Mini is extremely convenient. I use Readwise to capture my highlights and notes and Readwise Reader to keep up with RSS feeds, articles, and PDFs I want to read later. Readwise works flawlessly on the iPad Mini. I can use Kindle, Kobo, Libby, YouTube, or whatever else I want to consume content on the iPad Mini.</p>
<p>When it comes to blocking distractions, an e-ink reader is great because they’re so limited. The ones that are &ldquo;full-featured,&rdquo; like the Boox Go 7, are still slow and clunky due to how the screen refreshes. They are still great devices for simply reading but limited for other tasks.</p>
<p>I have set up Focus Modes on the iPad and other tricks to limit distractions. I also removed nearly everything from my phone with the intention to use the iPad for consumption and productivity. I realize, I’m just trading one device for another, almost identical device, but hey, I’m trying. </p>
<p>I’m sure I’ll change my mind again in the future. I’ll throw in a physical book or notebook when I’m needing to go more analog, but for now, the iPad Mini is my go-to device.</p>

			<h1><a href="https://ericgregorich.blog/2025/04/05/a-framework-for-thinking-about/">A framework for thinking about problems in society</a></h1>
		

		<a href="https://ericgregorich.blog/2025/04/05/a-framework-for-thinking-about/" class="u-url"><time class="dt-published" datetime="2025-04-05 09:29:00 -0400">Apr 5, 2025</time></a>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>I recently read <a href="https://waitbutwhy.com/whatsourproblem">What&rsquo;s Our Problem</a> by Tim Urban. This great book begins with a framework that describes how people think in today&rsquo;s society.</p>
<p>This post breaks down the framework and explains how we can use it to help make decisions about societal and political issues.</p>
<h2 id="two-types-of-thinking">Two types of thinking</h2>
<p>There are two types of thinking: Higher-Mind and Primitive-Mind. Higher-Mind thinking seeks truth based on evidence, while Primitive-Mind thinking leans on experience and emotions. Each of us engages in both types of thinking based on the topic.</p>
<h2 id="idea-spectrum">Idea Spectrum</h2>
<p>The Idea Spectrum can be considered a graph. The horizontal axis describes what you think, and the vertical axis describes how you think.</p>
<p>For example, take the statement &ldquo;Billionaires are evil.&rdquo; On the horizontal axis (I&rsquo;ll explain the vertical axis more below), the far left represents &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; while the far right represents &ldquo;No.&rdquo; However, this isn&rsquo;t simply a true or false statement, as nuance exists in how people arrive at those views and, we can be somewhere in the middle.</p>
<h2 id="the-ladder">The Ladder</h2>
<p>The vertical axis of the Idea Spectrum can be broken down further into what Tim calls &ldquo;The Ladder.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This &ldquo;Ladder&rdquo; has four rungs. Each rung represents a different type of thinking:</p>
<ul>
<li>The Scientist questions everything and seeks the truth.</li>
<li>The Sports Fan accepts the rules of the game but wants their team to win.</li>
<li>The Attorney strives to prove their point is the truth, even when its not.</li>
<li>The Zealot refuses everything that contradicts their opinions and beliefs.</li>
</ul>
<p>We all think on various rungs of the ladder about different things at different times. We don&rsquo;t strictly function as a &ldquo;Scientist&rdquo; or always as a &ldquo;Zealot.&rdquo; Reality isn&rsquo;t that simple. Our past knowledge and experience play a big part in how we think about a particular topic. How much a topic impacts you personally, based on your experience, may also influence your thinking.</p>
<p>The more emotions become involved, the more likely we think on the lower rungs of the ladder, while detachment may allow us to think more like a Scientist and find the facts.</p>
<h2 id="thinking-in-groups">Thinking in Groups</h2>
<p>Since society is made up of people on various sides of the horizontal axis of the Idea Spectrum, as well as on the vertical axis of The Ladder (described above), group dynamics become quite fascinating—and often messy.</p>
<p>When high and mid-rung thinkers gather, they generally seek the truth (or at least compromise) while showing respect for people they disagree with. Tim calls this group an &ldquo;Idea Lab.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When low and mid-rung thinkers gather, they form what is commonly called an &ldquo;Echo Chamber.&rdquo; They treat their opinions as facts and do not respect people who state otherwise. Emotions take over, and the lower they are on &ldquo;The Ladder&rdquo;, the more blind to different ideas they become.</p>
<p>Emerging from these Echo Chambers, Tim talks about a &ldquo;golem&rdquo; who tend to take on a life of their own. They define ideas blindly, frequently can&rsquo;t even explain what they&rsquo;re fighting for.</p>
<h2 id="applying-the-framework">Applying the framework</h2>
<p>How can we use this framework to make better, more informed opinions?</p>
<p>We can easily get caught up in our emotions when dealing with societal issues. These emotional reactions tell us a lot about ourselves. After all, we wouldn&rsquo;t have an emotional reaction to something if we didn&rsquo;t have some skin in the game.</p>
<p>At the same time, awareness of how we think and react can go a long way. We can take a step back to see which rung of &ldquo;The Ladder&rdquo; we&rsquo;re on.</p>
<p>We can also ask ourselves questions like, &ldquo;Is this coming from someone acting as a golem?&rdquo;, &ldquo;Where are the facts?&rdquo;, &ldquo;Am I seeking truth or confirmation of my beliefs?&rdquo;, and &ldquo;Can I even explain to someone why I think this?&rdquo;</p>
<h2 id="dont-get-too-caught-up-in-all-of-this">Don&rsquo;t get too caught up in all of this</h2>
<p>The last point I want to make is for myself as much as anyone. Don’t let this consume us! While it’s valuable to understand society and politics, obsessing over it can wear us down—especially when we’re stuck in social media or legacy media loops. Those Echo Chambers don’t help. Instead, limit our consumption, read books on topics we’re interested in, and keep learning. But realize, we can’t control it all!</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>A few days ago, my <a href="https://shop.boox.com/products/gocolor7">Boox Go Color 7</a> arrived. Yes, I did just start using a Kobo Clara, which I wrote about <a href="https://ericgregorich.blog/2024/12/28/switching-from-kindle-to-kobo.html">here</a>.</p>
<p>The main reason I wanted to try the Boox is that I can run any Android app on it. This means Readwise, Kindle, Kobo, Libby, and even <a href="Micro.blog">Micro.blog</a>.</p>
<p><img src="https://ericgregorich.micro.blog/uploads/2025/0a3cf4dd95.jpg" alt="The Boox Go Color 7"></p>
<p>It took me a couple of weeks to make the decision to even try the Boox. I had the device in my cart several times, then removed it, then added it back later. I couldn&rsquo;t make up my mind. I decided I could try it and then decide which device I&rsquo;ll keep and return the other.</p>
<ul>
<li>The Boox Go is slightly larger than the Kobo Clara. The Clara was noticeably small, and I found myself thinking it needed to be slightly larger but still very comfortable and light.</li>
<li>I&rsquo;m still able to read Kindle, Kobo, Libby, or transfer my own books to the device.</li>
<li>I&rsquo;m a pretty heavy user of Readwise Reader, and the app works great on Boox (with some minor configuration tweaks).</li>
<li>I like the hardware buttons.</li>
<li>The Clara shares a name with my mother-in-law. Weird.</li>
</ul>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to return the Kobo Clara and keep the Boox Go Color 7.</p>
<p>If someone asked me which I would recommend, my answer would be it depends on if you want it to just work (go with the Kobo) or want options and are willing to tinker a bit (go with the Boox).</p>

			 <p>I&rsquo;ve never been one to journal much, at least not in the &ldquo;deep reflection&rdquo; approach where I would write pages about what&rsquo;s on my mind every day.</p>
<h2 id="interstitial-journaling">Interstitial Journaling</h2>
<p>The journaling technique I started doing naturally is <a href="https://nesslabs.com/interstitial-journaling">Interstitial Journaling</a>, which is a log of my day as it happens.</p>
<p>I especially use Interstitial Journaling while I&rsquo;m working. It has a couple of benefits (that may not apply to everyone): 1) At the end of the day, I know what I worked on and when, so I can enter the time in my timesheet. 2) I can copy these notes and run them through Microsoft Copilot to generate a nice, bulleted summary of each project I worked on and what tasks I completed. I then paste that into my daily update that each of us sends over Microsoft Teams every workday.</p>
<h2 id="plus-minus-next-journaling">Plus Minus Next Journaling</h2>
<p>The other technique that I started just this week is <a href="https://nesslabs.com/plus-minus-next">Plus Minus Next Journaling</a>. It allows me to note what went well the previous week, what didn&rsquo;t, and then list any changes I want to make in the next week. I feel like this could be a great technique to reflect and plan without being too complex.</p>
<h2 id="reflect">Reflect</h2>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been using the <a href="https://reflect.app/">Reflect</a> notes app for both techniques. The Daily Notes in Reflect are perfect for Interstitial Journaling, and for the Plus Minus Next, I created a template that I can add to my daily note each week.</p>

			 <p>One of my resolutions for 2025 is to exercise more. At a bare minimum, I aim to get a quick cycle in or walk at my desk (treadmill) for a while. I have the equipment, but I failed miserably in 2024.</p>
<p>Perhaps the reason for this failure is that I either scheduled my workouts first thing in the morning or late in the day, after work.</p>
<p>I find that in the early mornings, I don&rsquo;t want to get out of bed, and when I&rsquo;m finally ready, my mind is already working, writing, or occupied with some activity that I want to start right away. So, I tend to skip the workout, telling myself I&rsquo;ll do it in the evening.</p>
<p>In the evenings, more often than not, I just keep busy with something right through my scheduled workout. Then, I&rsquo;m exhausted and tell myself, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll exercise in the morning.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Over the past few days, I&rsquo;ve tried a new technique. Mid-afternoon, when I start to get tired and still have things I want to accomplish, my brain begins to slow down. This seems to be the perfect time to get some exercise.</p>
<p>Forty-five minutes on the bike, and my blood is flowing, and my focus is back.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m fortunate enough to work from home and have a fairly flexible schedule that allows this mid-day break. If I have meetings, I can place the walking treadmill under my desk and at least get some steps in.</p>
<p>When I exercise regularly, I tend to eat better, sleep better, and feel better overall. No surprise.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m also hoping that talking about it motivates me to exercise more. I&rsquo;m at the age where I need to do this NOW, or it will be too late.</p>

<ul>
<li>End-to-end encryption</li>
<li>Markdown support</li>
<li>Keyboard shortcuts</li>
<li>Backlinks</li>
<li>Image and PDF OCR</li>

<li>Voice note transcription</li>
<li>Built-in AI (OpenAI or Anthropic) for manipulating text, creating custom prompts, or even chatting with AI about selected notes</li>
<li>Readwise (or direct Kindle) sync</li>
<li>Import and export of notes in Markdown and other formats</li>
</ul>
<p>Reflect feels like writing in the default notepad app on my OS, but with superpowers. The one big downside is the price tag: a $120 annual subscription. I&rsquo;ve been using Reflect for a year and tried switching to Obsidian, but I keep coming back.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@reflect-notes">Reflect YouTube channel</a> is a great resource for anyone interested.</p>

<p>A well-written productivity book that&rsquo;s full of actionable advice. However, as someone who is a productivity nerd, I didn&rsquo;t get too much from the book. I would recommend it for anyone who is new to the productivity space.</p>
<p>The book covers Top 3 priorities, saying no, creating lists, deep work, zero-based calendaring, finding your &ldquo;power hours&rdquo;, time reviews, procrastination, downtime (rest), using your environment, setting boundaries, creating plans, make the most out of meetings, mastering email, creating routines, meditation, and mindfulness.</p>
<p>The book is focused on what Laura calls the &ldquo;5 C&rsquo;s of Productivity&rdquo;, which include Capture, Consolidate, Close, Calm, and Create.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Urgent once, take care of it, Urgent seventeen times &hellip; something is wrong with the system.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>You can think of to-do lists like a funnel: start with the highest level of everything you could possibly do, or want to do, and narrow it down into what you actually will do hour by hour, based on time, energy, and priorities.</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>I&rsquo;ve been an Amazon Kindle user for about 14 years. This week, when deciding whether to upgrade to the latest Kindle Paperwhite, I instead chose to switch to Kobo to explore its offerings.</p>
<p>There are a few reasons that influenced my decision to switch:</p>
<ul>
<li>It lessens my dependency on Amazon.</li>
<li>Kobo has seamless integration with library books through Overdrive.</li>
<li>Kobo integrates smoothly with Pocket for reading articles.</li>
</ul>
<p>I went through a lengthy process when trying to decide what to get and even went down a rabbit hole, looking at the <a href="https://supernote.com/pages/supernote-nomad">Supernote Nomad</a>, <a href="https://shop.boox.com/products/gocolor7">Boox Go 7</a>, and even the <a href="https://us.kobobooks.com/products/kobo-libra-colour">Kobo Libra Colour</a>. Based on my past experience with the reMarkable 2 and Boox Palma, I decided to stick with something small and simple.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/229244/2024/kobo-clara-colour.jpeg" alt="Auto-generated description: A Kobo e-reader displays the cover of Salt, Fat, Acid, Heat by Samin Nosrat."></p>
<p>I went with the <a href="https://us.kobobooks.com/products/kobo-clara-colour">Kobo Clara Colour</a>, a small 6&quot; color e-ink reader.</p>
<p>When it arrived yesterday, my first impression was, &ldquo;Oh my lord, that&rsquo;s tiny.&rdquo; I immediately thought I should have gone with the Libre, which is larger and has hardware buttons.</p>
<p>However, as I started using it, I began to appreciate its lightness. It&rsquo;s almost as if I&rsquo;m just holding my hand in front of me, without anything in it.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m happy I chose the color version. It adds a nice touch, and I&rsquo;ve been wanting to read some graphic novels, so the color will be a treat.</p>
<p>I think I enjoy the Kobo interface better than the Kindle&rsquo;s. There are some nice shortcuts built in to make it easy to adjust the brightness and even switch to previous books in a snap.</p>
<p>The integration with Overdrive for library books works seamlessly. The Pocket integration works great as well. While I&rsquo;m not a fan of Pocket, simply creating an account to use the browser extension and the Share action in Feedbin makes it a breeze to add articles to the Kobo for reading.</p>
<p>I started tinkering with <a href="https://calibre-ebook.com/">Calibre</a> to try and get my books from Kindle, as well as some ePubs I already have, onto the Kobo. The ePubs worked great, while I&rsquo;m still struggling with the Kindle books. I&rsquo;ve followed some online tutorials and tried multiple Calibre plugins, but I&rsquo;m still not able to successfully download my Kindle books in the format Calibre needs to convert them to ePub. I&rsquo;m not worried about it, though. I think I&rsquo;m going to keep my Kindle anyway since I have probably hundreds, if not thousands, of ebooks and audiobooks on it already.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll be sure to post any significant updates!</p>

			 <p>I was listening to Scott Hanselman&rsquo;s <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_pPJvLjNrk">Hanselminutes podcast</a> with guest <a href="https://maggieappleton.com/">Maggie Appleton</a>, and they were talking about AI.</p>
<p>I agree with the discussion that LLMs (AI), in their current state, are best used for rubber ducking.</p>
<p>What is rubber ducking? It&rsquo;s a term often used by developers where the idea is that you have a rubber duck on your desk that you talk through a problem with. You don&rsquo;t necessarily need another person for this; often, you need to talk through the problem with yourself in order to discover the answer.</p>
<p>Today&rsquo;s LLMs excel at this. Give it a prompt that will act as a guide. Tell it to ask you questions about the problem. Let it answer questions, but respond with more questions for you to answer.</p>
<p>The back-and-forth is invaluable for figuring out problems and thinking through topics. You can do this on your own, but a good LLM can give you a big boost.</p>

			 <p>I never believed I would buy myself a $299 electric shaver, but here we are. To be fair, I used Christmas money (from this year and last year that I never spent) and just a little bit of my own cash to pay for it.</p>
<p>Is the <a href="https://www.usa.philips.com/c-p/SP9841_84/shaver-s9000-prestige-wet-dry-electric-shaver-with-senseiq">Philips S9000 Prestige</a> worth it? I love this thing so far. It provides a nice and smooth shave. It&rsquo;s also easy to clean since I purchased the model with the included cleaning and storage tub.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m using it to keep my head shaved, as well as my face (I have a beard, so not much to do there) and neck. Ideally, I will use this shaver every day, like brushing my teeth, since it only takes a minute or two to use it for maintenance.</p>
<p>I hope this thing lasts because I won&rsquo;t be buying another one anytime soon.</p>

			 <p>I&rsquo;ve been using the Whoop band for a couple of months now. My main reason for using Whoop is that I can wear it on my bicep and forget about it. Then, I get all kinds of data that I can use to improve my health.</p>
<p>I love data. But I hate digging for it.</p>
<p>One of the cool features is the use of AI within the Whoop app. With access to all of your data, the Whoop AI can tell you what you &ldquo;should&rdquo; be doing and give you better answers about what you did and how it impacts your health.</p>
<p>As a casual user, I appreciate this. Without digging through the app, I can ask things like, “How much time did I spend in Zone 2 this week?” and “How much time should I spend in Zone 2 this week?” and I get direct answers based on my data.</p>
<p>Even better, the daily insights usually provide the most relevant answers before I even need to ask them. I can see how much I should push myself today. It even provides recommendations of what workouts to do based on my past workouts. It&rsquo;s pretty useful.</p>

			 <p>Last week was pretty chill at work; everyone was wrapping up their tasks so they can start their time off for the holidays. You can tell nobody wants to start something new as they try to clear their plate. I do the same.</p>
<p>I find it&rsquo;s a good opportunity to clean up systems and reflect on what&rsquo;s working and what&rsquo;s not.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been making heavy use of Azure DevOps lately. Not only for managing our project tasks, but also utilizing the Wiki for documentation, and even dabbling in Pipelines for some automated deployments. I&rsquo;ve been cleaning up our projects in Azure DevOps and creating new processes to streamline our work.</p>
<p>It can be a challenge to find time to create and maintain documentation for work like mine (consulting work dealing with dozens of projects a year across several clients). Things tend to get forgotten or lost over time. I find a simple Wiki for each client is a great way to <em>point the way</em>, by containing documentation about how the solutions work, how to maintain them, and linking to any external documentation and resources.</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>I&rsquo;ve been trying Microsoft Copilot for the past couple of days. I&rsquo;ve been jumping around between Perplexity, Kagi Assistant, ChatGPT, Claude, Grok, and Google&rsquo;s Gemini trying to better understand which may work best for me long-term.</p>
<p>Copilot was recently updated with a simple and friendly UI. It&rsquo;s nice to use. However, I don&rsquo;t see any advanced features that power users will certainly want in their AI assistant. No projects, prompt configuration, no option to switch LLMs. The Pro version offers a simple &ldquo;Think Deeper&rdquo; button that, when clicked, switches to a more advanced model that helps the conversation go deeper. You&rsquo;ll also get priority access and other perks with Pro.</p>
<p>There is a Copilot Daily feature that reads today&rsquo;s top headlines. Today&rsquo;s headlines included a public service message to turn off lights when not in use, and headlines about the Apex fossil in the NY museum, Trump&rsquo;s goal to end daylight savings time, MicroStrategy to join Nasdaq-100 Index, Jared Padalecki&rsquo;s holiday message, and incentives to attract new residents in other countries. Overall, a good mix and summary of each. It was convenient to listen to it the past couple of days. As far as the ongoing content, we&rsquo;ll see.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s obvious Microsoft is trying to make Copilot the &ldquo;everyday user&rsquo;s&rdquo; AI. Since Copilot is included front-and-center, for better or worse, on Windows machines going forward, they want it to be as simple as possible.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not convinced any Power User will want to use it. But, I need more time with it to see if I&rsquo;m missing anything. The Pro version of Copilot is the standard $20 per month. I&rsquo;ll certainly need to try more advanced tasks to see if it&rsquo;s even worth considering.</p>

<p>🍿 Yesterday, the family and I went to see The Wild Robot. It was an excellent movie. The girls cried (several times). I didn’t (I’m not a crier), but they kept checking to see if I was. The movie was visually stunning, fun, and fast-paced. It is a kid’s movie, but the story is very deep, and adults will love it as well. My daughter thanked me for “making” her see it.</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>Passkeys were introduced fairly recently with the promise of no longer needing passwords. But the implementation of passkeys is still not mature.</p>
<h2 id="the-implementation-of-passkeys-is-not-standardized">The implementation of passkeys is not standardized.</h2>
<p>While many services have added passkeys as an option for authentication, it seems most still hang onto your password. They&rsquo;ll use a passkey as an alternative to your password or even require your password and use your passkey as another form of MFA. Ideally, when we set up a passkey, our password should be completely removed from the service. Or, if we&rsquo;re creating a new account, we never have a password to begin with.</p>
<h2 id="passkeys-are-not-easily-transferable">Passkeys are not easily transferable.</h2>
<p>If I create a passkey on my iPhone, I can&rsquo;t transfer it to another service, like 1Password. Hopefully, this problem will be solved soon.</p>
<h2 id="passkeys-are-simple-yet-not-widely-understood">Passkeys are simple, yet not widely understood.</h2>
<p>Ask my dad to set up a passkey and he&rsquo;ll give me a blank stare. “But where do I enter my password?” he&rsquo;ll say. It will take some time, and more consistent implementation, before the public are ready for passkeys.</p>
<p>I think the most important point of passkeys, if implemented correctly, is that the information needed to log into your account (your password) is never in the hands of the service you&rsquo;re trying to authenticate with. If the service still requires a password, then what&rsquo;s the point? Even if they still store your password, you&rsquo;re vulnerable to data breaches and phishing.</p>
<p>John Siracusa <a href="https://overcast.fm/+AAQ2lELn5co/34:28">talks about Passkeys</a> in the episode 609 of the ATP podcast and, as usual, explains how passkeys work and also brings up some of the same concerns.</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>📚 I was listening to the Bookworm podcast and the next book that the hosts will be talking about is Storyworthy, by Matthew Dicks.</p>
<p>I wasn’t interested in the book at first, as I’m not a storyteller, but then I thought there could be some useful tips in here for writing. Anyone who reads my writing knows I need all the help I can get.</p>
<p>So, I picked up a paperback copy of the book and gave it a shot. Was it good? Well, I finished it (although I skipped a little here and there), so that’s a good sign. </p>
<p>As you would expect, Storyworthy, is about creating good stories, so obviously, the book was full of stories. Not long stories. Rather, short, easy to read stories (that didn’t stop the author from plugging the long versions that are available on the website and YouTube channel).</p>
<p>As far as storytelling/writing tips, I was able to abstract a few that I found could be useful for elaborating in some of my writing. </p>
<ul>
<li>Every story should have a five-second moment. This is the moment when the story contains a turning-point. A transformation.</li>
<li>Every story must have an Elephant, which is a part of the story that is obvious. This may be a clear definition of the problem, or mystery. It signifies where the story is heading.</li>
<li>Always provide a physical location for each moment of the story. This gives your audience something to visualize. </li>
<li>The ideal connection between sentences is “but” and “therefore” including synonyms. Don’t use “and”. When your paragraphs can be connected by a silent “and”, then it feels like rambling. Instead, each should flow into the other.</li>
<li>Stories about failure are more engaging than those about success.</li>
<li>Your story must reflect change over time. Otherwise, what’s the point?</li>
</ul>
<p>I admit, at times I got lost and didn’t understand the point of what was said. I’d have to reread parts or look back (or forward) to see where the actionable advice is.</p>
<p>There are also a few very short chapters in the book that didn’t have any rhyme or reason for being there. They felt like filler text to make the book a bit longer.</p>
<p>Although I found some parts of the book tedious and disjointed, I found Storyworthy had enough practical advice, with examples, to help strengthen my non-technical writing. </p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>I had the opportunity to demo the Apple Vision Pro yesterday. The following is a write-up of my experience.</p>
<h2 id="the-demo">The Demo</h2>
<p>My store had a section blocked off with a couple of tables where a few people could do the demo simultaneously. Unfortunately, it was a sitting experience and quite loud in the room. It was not the ideal setup because of the noise and the other people in my “view,” but it didn’t deter the experience much.</p>
<h2 id="the-hardware">The Hardware</h2>
<p>Apple took my current glasses so they could add the appropriate lease to my demo device. While I waited, my guide told me what to expect and what her experience was with her first demo.</p>
<p>The device is very slick, made of high-quality materials, and looks very premium—precisely what you would expect from Apple.</p>
<p>I didn’t think much of the weight at first. I adjusted my straps, and while I could tell the weight was in the front, it didn’t seem significant or uncomfortable. A 20-minute demo is not enough to know.</p>
<p>One of the things I didn’t think about until after the demo was the audio. Nothing covers the ears, yet the audio sounded fairly good, even in a noisy room. It&rsquo;s different from with good headphones or a living-room sound system, but it&rsquo;s impressive, nonetheless.</p>
<h2 id="the-ui">The UI</h2>
<p>After some adjustments, the demo started. When things booted up, I looked to the side, where my UI was “stuck.” So, as I waited, I looked elsewhere and didn’t even see the boot-up sequence, where you’re looking when your Home Screen loads, which is where it will stay until you move it.</p>
<p>I remember glancing to the side and noticing the Home Screen floating there, and then I realized what was happening. I adjusted.</p>
<p>The UI looks spectacular. It just floats there in front of you. It looks as if you can touch it. Everything has a “soft” look to it. The area you’re looking at is crisper than the surrounding area, as in real life. This also makes it possible to put more processing power into the area you’re looking at rather than what you’re not.</p>
<p>As I look around with my eyes, the icons light up. Your eyes are your primary navigation (without getting into the accessibility options).</p>
<p>Clicking a selected UI element is evident. Tap your fingers together. I initially held my hands up when I did this, but I realized that was not necessary. As long as my hands were not obstructed under the table, it worked fine while resting.</p>
<p>There are other gestures for scrolling and zooming.</p>
<h2 id="the-environments">The Environments</h2>
<p>I was then guided through the UI and the “Environments” that could be enabled using your “Digital Crown” on the headset itself. You could fade the environment in and out. This allows you to sit in the Alaskan mountains or on a beach while you work or play.</p>
<h2 id="photos-and-videos">Photos and Videos</h2>
<p>Next, I took a tour of some photos taken on various iPhones. Initially, they were standard photos that looked great. I could easily resize and zoom in and out. Next were the spatial photos, which were taken from newer iPhones or the Vision Pro itself. These photos were much more realistic and had a depth that didn’t look “fake 3D” but more lifelike than any other photo I’ve seen.</p>
<p>I then experienced the video, in which I’m sitting at a table with the family watching the young girl blowing out her birthday cake candles. This was the first “oh wow” that came out of my mouth. Other than the limited field of view from the goggles, it felt like I was sitting in the room.</p>
<p>After experiencing this, I genuinely understand why we would want to record these moments so that we may watch them again whenever we want. It was remarkable. On the other hand, I don’t envision myself wanting to wear a Vision Pro during these moments. Maybe recording with a phone instead. There needs to be a better way to record these moments without being taken out of the moment itself.</p>
<h2 id="movies">Movies</h2>
<p>Next, there was a quick demo of the Mario movie. During this, I was able to resize the window to “Movie Screen” size and experience what it is like to watch a movie with the Vision Pro. I could envision myself watching movies on this device. However, some movies are ideal for Vision Pro, while others may not. This video explains it well.</p>
<h2 id="the-recap">The Recap</h2>
<p>Last was a 5-minute video that explored various landscapes, including mountain climbing, flying, interacting with rhinos, and a few other things.</p>
<p>I did back up when the Rhine came at me. I could feel things slightly that were not there, like the mist or the chilly rain. My mind was filling in the gaps. It was cool.</p>
<h2 id="the-demo-ends">The demo ends</h2>
<p>This concluded my demo. I was a bit disappointed it ended so quickly. I expected to see some dinosaurs, touch a butterfly, and experience the mindfulness features. Not only that, but I didn’t experience Personas or what it would be like to use a Mac or take a Zoom call—things I would expect to use in real life.</p>
<h2 id="motion-sickness">Motion Sickness</h2>
<p>I’m someone who gets motion sickness quickly. I can’t ride in the back seat of a car on long trips or ride rollercoasters. Yet, I didn’t have any problems at all with the Vision Pro. I may have felt slightly unbalanced when I was suddenly on a high tightrope looking over a river. But that’s part of the experience.</p>
<h2 id="long-periods">Long Periods?</h2>
<p>Could I use the Vision Pro for extended periods? Could I use it to work on my computer? Read a book? Watch movies? I don’t know for sure. While the device was comfortable during the 20 minutes I wore it, I did notice I was very sweaty when I took it off. I would imagine it would get uncomfortable to use it for more than a couple of hours at a time.</p>
<h2 id="antisocial">Antisocial?</h2>
<p>A big issue with the Vision Pro is that it is primarily a solo experience. While you can optionally see other people in the room and interact with them, they won’t see what you see. What if I want to watch a show with my wife or a movie with my kids? I suspect Apple will resolve this over time. There will be more ways to have a shared experience, assuming each of you has a Vision Pro.</p>
<h2 id="will-i-buy-a-vision-pro">Will I buy a Vision Pro?</h2>
<p>I react similarly to Vision Pro as most people do. It’s technically outstanding but too expensive, and I don’t think I would use it enough.</p>
<p>No, I won’t buy this first version of the Apple Vision Pro.</p>
<p>I will undoubtedly watch the following versions to see how Apple improves things. If they make it a little lighter, a lot cheaper, and more capable (especially in multi-player), then it will be much more interesting for me.</p>
<p>As it stands, I don’t know if there are many benefits to the Vision Pro as a “productivity” device. It could replace your expensive monitors. Then, you can easily take your setup with you, even to a coffee shop.</p>
<p>There are certainly some situations that sound wonderful with the Apple Vision Pro. I don’t think there’s a difference between comfort and battery life yet. I’m excited to see what it looks like in a few years.</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>I’m losing my ability to read deeply and understand what I’m reading, and I’m not the only one.</p>
<p>I used to read for hours, fully immersed. I’d put the book down and still think about it, processing and connecting it for a deeper understanding and recall.</p>
<p>Today, we’re consumed by digital email, chats, TikTok, social media, short blogs, video clips, and other quick consumption forms. The content is designed to keep us engaged.</p>
<p>There must be a connection between today’s consumption and the ability to read and think critically.</p>
<p>Today, I struggle to read a book with information I want to understand. My mind jumps to other things. I can’t focus enough to comprehend what I read. I even read the prior text and don’t recall it. I have to read a paragraph repeatedly to understand it.</p>
<p>The book is too difficult to read because it requires more direct attention, unlike other material I consume. My mind isn’t wired for the focus I need.</p>
<p>This is troubling.</p>
<p>Oddly enough, it doesn’t apply to everything. I often become fully engaged when writing code and building software solutions. It may take a few minutes to get going, but once I do, I’m so engrossed in my work that I need someone to shake my shoulder to get my attention.</p>
<p>Do the books need to be more attractive to grab my attention like coding? Is it because I’m creating and not consuming when I’m coding?</p>
<p>Today’s books are written differently. Old books are denser, with complicated words, paragraphs, and less fluff. Today’s books are straightforward, full of short stories, and skim the material’s surface to maintain reader interest.</p>
<p>If I had the abilities in the past and slowly lost them, they could be reversed. Right?</p>
<p>My next steps sound simple but will be challenging to execute. Reduce the short, mind-numbing consumption and replace it with more time with evergreen material that encourages me to slow down and think. This should help rebuild the muscle of deep reading and thinking.</p>
<p>What does this problem mean for my children? How will they solve the world’s problems if they can’t focus for more than 20 minutes?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>For two weeks, that&rsquo;s all I do. I just write it down. I don&rsquo;t tell the team everything that I think they&rsquo;re doing wrong. I don&rsquo;t show up at retro with all the stuff I think they need to change. I just watch, and listen, and I write down everything that seems deeply weird.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>For a couple of weeks, you observe and write down anything that makes you think &ldquo;WTF&rdquo; in your notebook. You are accumulating a list of things that are unusual from your outsider perspective. Later, you can meet with the team or group and review what you noted. An interesting approach.</p>

			 <p>I know I have notes scattered all over in various apps. Evernote, Bear, Ulysses, Apple Notes, Reflect, Mymind, and Obsidian to name a few.</p>
<p>Since I never know where a note is, I don&rsquo;t use them often and even create duplicate notes because if forget where it is or forget I already have the note.</p>
<p>I want to consolidate them into one place.</p>
<p>But where?</p>
<p>Currently, I&rsquo;m strongly considering Obsidian, but I need to sit on that for a while. I have a strange relationship with Obsidian. Every time I look at it fresh, I remember how powerful it is and possible to organize any way I want. But then I use it for a while and quickly get frustrated for one reason or another.</p>

			 <p>I like the idea of creating static pages that I can continuously update over time.</p>
<p>This type of content does not fit as well in a chronological blog since they are always updated and are not relevant to a specific date.</p>
<p>I created a <a href="https://ericgregorich.com/tools+I+use">Tools I use</a> page and a <a href="https://ericgregorich.com/search+engines">Search Engines</a> page to start.</p>

			 <p>While moving things around on my sites a few weeks ago, I realized I lost the &ldquo;<a href="https://ericgregorich.com/Lists/Tools+I+Use">Tools I Use</a>&rdquo; page that I had set up. This is one of the downsides to changing things too often.</p>
<p>Anyway, I created a new page. I decided to use my Obsidian Publish account since I still have an ongoing subscription. I think pages like this would be effortless to update from Obsidian. I may add more pages to that site, including a list of search engines, static site generators, favorite newsletters, podcasts, etc. Obsidian Publish should work well for &ldquo;static&rdquo; pages that are updated over time and independent of the chronological order of a blog.</p>
<p>Here is my current <a href="https://ericgregorich.com/tools-i-use/">Tools I use</a> page.</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>I created a Working Memory file that I’ll use throughout the day. I learned this from <a href="https://www.calnewport.com/blog/2015/10/27/deep-habits-workingmemory-txt-the-most-important-productivity-tool-youve-never-heard-of/">Cal Newport</a>, although I’m sure he didn’t invent the idea.</p>
<p>The idea is to have a single text file open all day that you use to write all of your notes, today’s tasks, etc. Similar to a Daily Note available in some applications, like Roam Research, Logseq, or Obsidian, except this file persists from day to day.</p>
<p>I clean up the file daily, move tasks to my task system, and save important notes into my note application. My Working Memory file also has a list of active projects with the current status that I keep up to date, as well as a short list of things I want to remember.</p>
<p>The purpose is not to jump in and out of applications all day, which is one of my struggles.</p>
<p>I’m on Windows (for work), and Notepad was too basic; I tried iAWriter, but while I like writing with Markdown, I don’t want to see the Markdown. Now, I’m trying Typora, which uses Markdown, but with a live preview.</p>
<p>So far, I love this approach. It keeps everything within easy reach and forces me to review every day.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>So in 2023, I switched gears to emphasize <em>intimacy</em>. Instead of statistical analysis and summative interviews, I sat next to individuals for hours, as they used one-off prototypes which I’d made just for them. And I got more insight in the first few weeks of this than I had in all of 2022.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Andy&rsquo;s article makes me think about a significant project that involves getting a large organization to adopt standard processes.</p>
<p>Nearly every small team at this company has developed its own process to achieve the same goal over the years. Selling them a new way of doing things has been a chore.</p>
<p>Designing this overarching process has been a challenge. To Andy&rsquo;s point, spending time with individuals has been more beneficial than meeting in groups. It&rsquo;s more time-consuming and rewarding and often results in better information to use for the solution.</p>

<p>But your RSS reader doesn’t (shouldn’t?) be there to add to your to-do list. Your RSS reader is a list of things you might like to read. In an ideal world, reaching “RSS Zero” would mean that you’ve seen everything on the Internet that you might enjoy. That’s not enlightened; that’s sad!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>A good point about how our RSS reader should not be treated the same as our email.</p>
<p>It’s tough for me knowing I have things in the queue. I have to mark them as read to declare bankruptcy often. I need to get over that.</p>

<p>I’m experimenting with this myself. I’m using Hey as my email client, and all of my newsletters go into “The Feed,” a dedicated page where I can scroll through all my newsletters. If I find something interesting, I can expand it and keep reading.</p>
<p>Where <a href="https://blogtrottr.com/about/" title="Blogtrottr">Blogtrottr</a> helps me is for those websites that don’t provide a newsletter, or when they do, it doesn’t contain the actual content I want to read. Blogtrottr takes the RSS feed and sends any new content to your email. Simple!</p>
<p>In addition, Blogtrottr also lets you set up a daily digest. For those feeds that are very active, this is a great feature.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I think that the appeal of AI hits the same chord for many people looking at their notes. They want to have neatly compiled notes with clearly thought-out ideas that resonate with others. They want to be done with the hard work of writing their ideas down poorly 20,000 times until they come up with a single good idea that they can run with.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>People figure AI will do this for them, but if your notes are crap to begin with, the output of any AI will also be crap.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is a good reminder that while many apps are gaining AI superpowers, the LLMs can’t replace our thinking and ideas. Sure, they can help spark ideas and maybe some other use cases, but they won’t do the hard work for you. Especially when it comes to personal knowledge management. What’s the point of handling over your learning to AI? The real learning comes from doing the work to understand something and how it relates to other things, not by letting some software do it for you.</p>

			 <p>After giving iA Writer another brief go, I’m sticking with Ulysses.</p>
<p>Ulysses has a customizable writing experience, handles images well, has built-in grammar tools, and, most importantly, has seamless publishing to Micro.blog, where my sites are hosted.</p>
<p>These reasons make Ulysses the easiest to open up on mobile (which I’m doing now) or the Mac and start writing. If it’s something I want to share, I hit publish.</p>
<p>I’ve also tried Obsidian, Typora, and Reflect. Each has some excellent features, but from a writing and publishing perspective, none are as simple and reliable as Ulysses.</p>
<p>My biggest issue is that Ulysses is Mac and iOS only. If I want to write a blog post for <a href="https://thepowerarchitect.com" title="The Power Architect">The Power Architect</a>, I must do it from my Mac. Maybe that’s a better experience anyway.</p>
<p>As far as notes go, I’ve been dumping private notes into Apple Notes and everything else into Ulysses. Much of it gets posted to my blog. I’m not a big note taker lately.</p>

			 <p>As I get older (now 47), maintaining my health has become more important than ever, and I&rsquo;ve been neglecting it recently. It could be worse, but it&rsquo;s certainly not great.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been focusing on improving several key health habits, including sleep, exercise, and nutrition.</p>
<p>One habit I hope will be beneficial is consistently monitoring my fitness. This includes tracking my weight, body fat, sleep, and other factors.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve tried calorie counting in the past, but it didn&rsquo;t stick. It was too much work. However, I believe that weighing myself every day or at least every few days would be manageable.</p>
<p>I started with a basic bathroom scale. It was rather mundane and required me to manually use my phone, which I usually don&rsquo;t have on hand when I&rsquo;m weighing myself, to open the health app and log my weight.</p>
<p>So, today, I decided to buy a &ldquo;smart&rdquo; scale. There were more options for these devices than I expected.</p>
<p>The most crucial feature, aside from measuring my weight, was that it needed WiFi sync to automatically synchronize with my phone without any effort on my part.</p>
<p>Being the person I am, I delved into the technical specifications of these scales and ended up buying one of the most expensive consumer options available, the <a href="https://www.withings.com/us/en/body-comp">Withings Body Comp</a>.</p>
<p>Now, I can not only weigh myself daily but also track all sorts of other metrics that I don&rsquo;t fully understand.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sure this scale will be like all the other gadgets I get excited about and purchase. It will undoubtedly change my life, until it doesn&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>But seriously, I&rsquo;m hoping to establish some basic habits that will help me stay in this world a bit longer.</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>📚 According to the book <a href="https://micro.blog/books/9781439144831">How to Read a Book by Mortimer J. Adler and Charles Van Doren</a>, there are four reading levels. Each level has a purpose and is stacked upon each other; in other words, you can’t complete a level without first completing the previous level. Most material we read, including books, papers, and articles, is not worth our time to read at all four levels. Instead, an Inspectional or maybe Analytical reading will suffice.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Elementary Reading is what we learn in elementary school and is the fundamentals of reading. It involves understanding the words we read, not necessarily what the author tries to say.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Inspectional Reading is the reading we do with a limited amount of time. It involves skimming the book to understand what key concepts are covered. This is a great way to determine if a book is worth the time for analytical reading. During Inspectional Reading, we understand the meaning of the Title, read through the table of contents, check the index, skim through the chapters, and do a general skim through the material. Next, if it is a difficult book, we should start with a superficial reading, reading from beginning to end without trying to make sense of things.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Analytical Reading is a thorough and complete reading of the material for fundamental understanding.</p>
<ol>
<li>Know what kind of book you are reading.</li>
<li>Summarize the whole book in as few words as possible.</li>
<li>Understand the significant parts of the book.</li>
<li>Figure out what the author’s problems were.</li>
<li>Locate the important words the author is using and determine the meaning of these words as used by the author.</li>
<li>Mark the most important sentences in the book.</li>
<li>Construct the basic arguments by finding them in the connection of sentences.</li>
<li>Figure out what the author’s solutions are.</li>
<li>You must be able to say “I understand” before you can agree or disagree with the author.</li>
<li>When you do disagree, do so reasonably.</li>
<li>Respect the differences between knowledge and personal opinion. When you disagree, be sure you can state why.
<ol>
<li>Is the author uninformed?</li>
<li>Is the author misinformed?</li>
<li>Is the author being illogical?</li>
<li>Is the author’s analysis incomplete?</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>Syntopical Reading occurs when we read multiple sources on the same topic and use them to create an even greater understanding of the material, compare the opinions of the authors, and form a deep understanding of the material.</p>
</li>
</ol>

<p>Look for wisdom, not facts. We’re not reading to just find random pieces of information. What’s the point of that? We’re reading to accumulate a mass of true wisdom—that you can turn to and apply in your actual life. - Ryan Holiday</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The purpose of reading a wide variety of book types is to gain a broader understanding of the world, not just to memorize facts. There&rsquo;s no need for us to become human encyclopedias.</p>
<p>The ability to make connections from a wide expanse of experience is what makes us better.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Pet Rock is a collectible toy made in 1975 by advertising executive Gary Dahl. Pet Rocks are smooth stones from Mexico&rsquo;s Rosarito Beach. They were marketed like live pets, in custom cardboard boxes, complete with straw and breathing holes. The fad lasted about six months, ending after a short increase in sales during the Christmas season of December 1975.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I stumbled up on this user manual about how to care and train your pet rock. All my problems are solved.</p>

<p>But simply abiding by the rules doesn’t make excellent writing — it makes conventional, unremarkable writing, the kind usually found in business reports, policy memos and research articles.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The article discusses how AI can be used for writing. While it may produce concise and clear content, it cannot yet evoke the emotional responses from readers that a skilled human writer can.</p>

			 <p>Finished reading: <a href="https://micro.blog/books/9780593138779">The Comfort Crisis</a> by Michael Easter 📚</p>
<p>It is a nice blend of story and scientific evidence stating how we have grown too comfortable in our day-to-day lives.</p>
<p>No big surprises were revealed. Yet an interesting story made it enjoyable to read. It was inspiring but depressing knowing how much healthier I could be with significant lifestyle changes.</p>

			 <p><a href="https://micro.blog/books/9780593138779">The Comfort Crisis</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;This creep phenomenon applies directly to how we now relate to comfort, said Levari. Call it comfort creep. When a new comfort is introduced, we adapt to it, and our old comforts become unacceptable. Today’s comfort is tomorrow’s discomfort. This leads to a new level of what’s considered comfortable.&rdquo; (Michael Easter, The Comfort Crisis)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We&rsquo;re constantly getting comfortable with our lives. Each comfort replaces other comforts, and we get deeper and deeper into the comfort hole, making it harder to get out.</p>

<p>The biggest problem with changing tools is that it feels like progress. You suddenly feel like you’re getting something done, but you’re not. You’re merely shuffling deck chairs, but it feels like you’re making progress.</p>

<p>Curtis talks about how switching tools can feel productive. I’ve indeed fallen into this trap (and am still falling).</p>
<p>Focus on the system and not the tools. Track your problems and only switch tools after evaluating and making an informed decision.</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>Finished reading: <a href="https://micro.blog/books/9780593236604">Outlive</a> by Peter Attia, MD 📚</p>
<p>The book Outlive by Peter Attia, MD is a guide to learning and planning for a long, healthy life. It is very detailed and covers the science behind it, as well as providing actionable advice. <em><strong>This post includes some of my notes from the book and the author&rsquo;s other content.</strong></em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;There comes a point where we need to stop just pulling people out of the river. We need to go upstream and find out why they’re falling in. —Bishop Desmond Tutu</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Here&rsquo;s an example schedule of the recommended training from this book. This is the minimum time you need to spend to get the benefits that will extend your life. Of course, any exercise is better than none!</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<h2 id="objectives-strategies-and-tactics">Objectives, Strategies, and Tactics</h2>
<p>Simply seeing your physician every year for an annual physical is not enough. This only evaluates what’s happening with your health <em>now</em>. You need to be proactive if you want to live longer. If you want to play the long-game with your life, you need to start with your objective, then define a strategy, then define tactics.</p>
<p>Your <strong>objectives</strong> would inlude defining what you want to be able to do in your old age. Common examples include picking up and playing with grandchildren, walking your dog, not be in pain, etc.</p>
<p>You then reverse-engineer your objectives and create a <strong>strategy</strong>.  The strategy is the higher level approach to how you will achieve your goals. What will you learn, what ways will you approach the problems.</p>
<p>The <strong>tactics</strong> are the things you do day-to-day and week-to-week that will help you achieve your objective.</p>
<h2 id="insulin-resistance">Insulin Resistance</h2>
<p>Insulin resistance is a major contributor to cancer, Alzheimer&rsquo;s, heart disease, and other medical conditions. It occurs when the body&rsquo;s cells don&rsquo;t respond correctly to insulin, which results in too much glucose entering the muscles and organs.</p>
<p>Surprisingly, exercise is the most effective way to combat insulin resistance, not nutrition.</p>
<h2 id="zone-2-training">Zone 2 Training</h2>
<p>Zone 2 training involves low-intensity exercise that is active enough for you to have a conversation without running out of breath. It is typically 70-85% of your peak heart rate.</p>
<p>During Zone 2, most of the work is done by your &ldquo;slow-twitch&rdquo; muscles that are rich in mitochondria. The mitochondria are “the power plants of the cell” and Zone 2 training can help them use fat as fuel.</p>
<p>To benefit and improve your health, you need at least 3 hours of Zone 2 training per week, split into four 45-minute sessions.</p>
<h2 id="vo2-max-training">VO2 Max Training</h2>
<p>VO2 Max is the highest rate at which a person can use oxygen during strenuous exercise. It is an indicator of aerobic fitness and endurance performance.</p>
<p>Achieving VO2 Max can be done by working at maximum intensity for four minutes, followed by a four-minute rest period. Repeat this cycle four times per week and measure your VO2 Max annually to measure progress. Apple Health and other fitness trackers have built-in VO2 Max measurements, though they may be less accurate than tests you can get at a medical facility.</p>
<p>Having a VO2 Max below average doubles the risk of death, which is even greater than the risk posed by smoking.</p>
<p>If your new to exercising, focus on Zone 2 Training for 6 months before starting VO2 Max Training.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>VO2 Max is perhaps the most powerful marker for longevity. - Peter Attia, MD</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="strength-training">Strength Training</h2>
<p>Strength training increases muscle mass, which uses excess glucose. As we age, we lose muscle, so the more muscle mass we can build while we&rsquo;re younger, the more we&rsquo;ll have stored for our later years.</p>
<p>To maximize the benefits of strength training, perform exercises 3 days per week with a focus on grip strength. Examples of exercises that target concentric, eccentric, and isometric strength include farmer&rsquo;s carry, deadlifts, and more. Eccentric strength is especially important to prevent injuries, such as the ability to stop yourself from falling.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s also important to note that strength training is not effective if we don&rsquo;t consume enough protein in our diet. Aim for about 1g of protein per pound of total body weight per day (2.2g/kg/day).</p>
<h2 id="stability-training">Stability Training</h2>
<p>Stability is essential for training, as it helps to prevent injury and is necessary for strength and performance. When we lack stability, we might be strong, but we are wasting energy in the wrong places, such as joints and other muscles, which prevents us from reaching our full potential. <sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup></p>
<p>To ensure stability, dedicate 10-15 minutes of your day to stability training and one hour twice a week. Focus on Dynamic Neuromuscular Stabilization (DNS), which is based on natural movements.. <sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup></p>
<h2 id="nutrition">Nutrition</h2>
<p>When it comes to nutrition, there are some key principles to follow. One of them is getting enough protein. Protein is the most important macronutrient and we often don&rsquo;t consume enough of it. As we age, it becomes even more important to aim for 1g/lb/day (2.2g/kg/day) of protein, based on our current body weight. This should be spread out throughout the day, as excess protein can be converted into glucose.</p>
<p>In addition to protein, strive to eat healthy most of the time. Whole foods are preferable to processed food. However, the best approach is to monitor your own nutrition and adjust according to what works for you.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Getting nutrition wrong has far more negative consequences than getting it right. <sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="sleep">Sleep</h2>
<p>We need to sleep between 7 1/2 and 8 1/2 hours each night. Sleep deprivation can lead to insulin resistance. High stress can lead to poor sleep, which can further increase stress levels.</p>
<p>Studies show that sleeping less than 6 hours is associated with a 20% higher risk of heart attack. People who sleep less during middle age years are more likely to develop dementia later in life.</p>
<p>A couple of hours before bedtime, turn off unnecessary lights, especially LED, and replace blue lights with warmer colored lights. Get at least half an hour of sunlight during the day, which will also help with sleep. Keep your room and bed cool while sleeping.</p>
<h2 id="breathing">Breathing</h2>
<p>Breathing is essential for balance, motion, and power. It also reflects our emotional state. Long, slow breaths can suggest relaxation, while short, quick breaths can suggest anxiety.</p>
<p>An ideal inhalation engages the entire rib cage and abdomen simultaneously.</p>
<h2 id="mental-health">Mental Health</h2>
<p>Investigate Dialectical Behavior Therapy (DBT), a therapeutic approach designed to help people process trauma. It can also be beneficial for those with less severe emotional health concerns. <sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">4</a></sup></p>

			 <p>I&rsquo;ve always struggled to commit to using Apple Notes as my main notes app because it is difficult to get notes out. While some apps and tools are available to help with bulk exporting from Apple Notes, it still feels like a lock in. The other reason is, while I think Apple notes is great for capturing, I don&rsquo;t prefer to write in it. It&rsquo;s something about the layout, formatting options that bother me.</p>
<p>However, when I think about the way I use my note&rsquo;s app (at least how I want to use it) is as a scratchpad for capturing information that will be later transformed and shared as something new. When I think of it this way, I feel more comfortable with Apple Notes because I realize it is just a tool that I use to create the real value that is created and shared elsewhere. I could replace Apple Notes without needing to migrate all the content.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been using Ulysses to do all of my writing recently since, not only is it a great writing tool, but also great for publishing (to Micro.blog and Ghost in my case). I&rsquo;ll be trying Apple Notes for a while as my scratchpad where I throw ideas, sketches, bookmarks, and other things of interest. The fuel I need to create better content.</p>

Hosts Joe Buhlig and Mike Schmitz drop a new episode every couple of weeks, and they give a thorough review of each book. It&rsquo;s been a huge help for me when it comes to deciding which books I wanna read.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The concept of Personal Knowledge Management (PKM) is flawed in that it fails to recognize that there is more to knowledge management than simply collecting, storing, and organizing data. Rather, knowledge management is a process of transforming data into information and then into knowledge through the application of cognitive processes.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>While PKM tools can be helpful in collecting, organizing, and connecting the information you gather, it is up to you to do something with that information to turn it into knowledge.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>At the end of every weekday, I go through and color-code my calendar from the day that just finished.
Green = Energy Creating Yellow = Neutral Red = Energy Draining. I don’t spend too much time thinking about which bucket each item fell into—I try to trust my gut.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I like this idea of color coding the calendar to show what gives you energy vs. what drains your energy. It could be a great way to work on balancing things out. I&rsquo;m not sure I&rsquo;ll do it, but I&rsquo;ll keep it in mind.</p>

			 <p>I&rsquo;ve been quiet the past couple of weeks. I&rsquo;m working on a few things, including some website updates. I moved my Micro.blog site to <a href="https://ericgregorich.com">blog.ericgregorich.com</a> and moved my <a href="https://ericgregorich.com">main site</a> to <a href="https://blot.im">Blot.im</a>.</p>
<p>The only reason for this move is because Blot fits my workflow better. I can take all my markdown notes in Obsidian and easily publish them to my website using Git. I have local markdown files for everything, which is my goal.</p>

<p>The goal is the target we want to achieve, while the aim is the course we set to reach that target. A goal fixates on the finish line, while an aim considers the trajectory.

			 <p>The Revue newsletter service owned by Twitter is being <a href="https://www.platformer.news/p/inside-twitters-product-roadmap-under">shut down</a> by the end of the year. What I liked about the Revue service was the ability to easily integrate other services, like RSS, to make it easier to build a link-based newsletter.</p>

<p>Feast your eyes on this! On what? I don&rsquo;t know.</p>

<p>Phase 1 is to consolidate my existing notes. I already see the benefits!</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>I stumbled across this <a href="http://richardcarter.com/sidelines/charles-darwins-note-making-system">article</a> by Richard Carter that describes how Charles Darin took notes.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If you were to keep a portfolio open for a couple of years, and throw in slips of paper as subjects crossed your mind, you would soon have a skeleton (and that seems to me the difficulty) on which to put the flesh and colours in your inimitable manner.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Darwin would mark up books, write literature notes, and even create a rough abstract of the books he read. He originally would use bound notebooks but later found them too restrictive, favoring the loose slips of paper instead.</p>
<p>The main takeaway is that he did not create a perfect system from the beginning, It always changed. The key is to capture notes and revisit them to create something useful.</p>
