		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>The Pomodoro Technique is a productivity hack where you set a timer for 25 minutes and then start a task and only work on that single task for 25 minutes. After the 25 minutes are up, you stop what you&rsquo;re doing, take a 5-minute break, then start another 25-minute session. After 4 sessions, you take a longer break.</p>
<p>Telling yourself you only need to work on a task for 25 minutes is a great way to get started. We often overcomplicate things in our mind and delay getting started.</p>
<p>There are some downsides to the Pomodoro Technique. One is that you&rsquo;re interrupted every 25 minutes. It may take you 20 minutes to get focused on the task, and then you&rsquo;re interrupted by your timer. Should you take the break regardless? You could, but your break should be to step away, stretch, look out a window, grab some water, all the while you&rsquo;re still thinking about your task. When you&rsquo;re back to the task, you should (hopefully) be able to jump right back into it.</p>
<p>You can create your own variations of the Pomodoro Technique. Try 55 minutes of work, 10-minute break. See what works for you.</p>

<p>Humans find an octopus colony that appears to have culture and language, and are defending themselves from the outside world (humans). While it may sound far-fetched, the book was very grounded in a near future reality. The story dives into deep topics such as AI, Androids, what is consciousness, and what makes us human.</p>
<p>This was a sci-fi book that felt real and made me think about these topics even when I wasn&rsquo;t reading. I really enjoyed it.</p>

			 <p>I&rsquo;ve had an off and on relationship with Obsidian for some time now. I want to love the app, but after using it for a period, I always end up frustrated, and I move to something else.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve started to use Obsidian in a way that works for me. More on that in a minute. First some venting.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know exactly what it is that I don&rsquo;t like about Obsidian.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s the way you interact with files. It&rsquo;s also the ugly search, file presentation, backlinks, and so many other things that irritate me. It all seems to work okay, but not for me. If I were to try to pinpoint a part of Obsidian that I don&rsquo;t like, it&rsquo;s the Organization of my content. It all makes sense in theory, but execution is where it gets me.</p>
<p>Obsidian has failed me when I tried to use it as a Notes application. When I attempt to use it as a Capture tool, then make connections between notes, etc. All of that PKM jargon I&rsquo;ve come to find pretty useless for me.</p>
<p>The other thing that I have a love/hate relationship with is the Plugins. On one hand, Obsidian can be very overwhelming with everything that&rsquo;s possible. On the other hand, I can make Obsidian work the way I want it to, by enabling or disabling third-party and core plugins.</p>
<p>Now that the venting is out of the way, I&rsquo;ll talk about how I started to use Obsidian and make it work for me.</p>
<p>What I do love about Obsidian is that it is local-first. My files are simple Markdown text files that live on my computer. I can take them anywhere, and use them with other applications.</p>
<p>I also like the writing experience in Obsidian, mostly. The Live Preview Markdown mode can be weird sometimes, but for simple writing, it&rsquo;s pretty good.</p>
<p>The other thing I&rsquo;ve come to quite enjoy is how I can write something and publish to Micro.blog using the Micro Publish plugin. It&rsquo;s pretty seamless. I can&rsquo;t wait for image support!</p>
<p>I now open Obsidian to a blank screen, which creates a new note in the Drafts folder. I use CTRL-N to create a new note. Then I write. When it&rsquo;s ready, I publish. Then I drag that file to a folder named Posts, where I store my published content. I also have a Pages folder where I can keep Pages on my blog updated.</p>
<p>If I need to find an existing note that I need to update, I use the built-in Quick Switcher (CTRL-O).</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s mostly it. I&rsquo;m using Obsidian solely as a writing tool. And I find I&rsquo;m truly enjoying it now.</p>
<p>I have a few plugins that help me accomplish this:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="obsidian://show-plugin?id=microblog-publish-plugin">Micro Publish</a> : Post to Micro.blog.</li>
<li><a href="obsidian://show-plugin?id=obsidian-focus-mode">Focus Mode</a>: To toggle into focus mode where I only see the note itself</li>
<li><a href="obsidian://show-plugin?id=obsidian-languagetool-plugin">Language Tools</a>: Built in Grammar checking.</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/Akifyss/obsidian-border">Border theme</a>: My favorite theme at the moment.</li>
<li><a href="obsidian://show-plugin?id=obsidian-style-settings">Style Settings</a>: For tweaking the Border theme to my liking.</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="https://blog.ericgregorich.com/uploads/2024/myobsidianplugins.png" alt="My Obsidian Plugins"></p>
<p>Here is a screenshot of what Obsidian looks like when not in Focus Mode.</p>
<p><img src="https://blog.ericgregorich.com/uploads/2024/obsidian-with-focusmode-disabled.png" alt="My Obsidian with Focus Mode Disabled"></p>
<p>And here with Focus Mode enabled.</p>
<p><img src="https://blog.ericgregorich.com/uploads/2024/obsidian-with-focusmode-enabled.png" alt="Obsidian with Focus Mode enabled"></p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sure I&rsquo;ll keep tweaking things now and then. That&rsquo;s how I work. But overall, I&rsquo;m loving the simplicity of this setup.</p>

<p>This is a great feature. I’ll likely incorporate it into the <a href="https://cards.ericgregorich.com/">Cards Theme</a>, but I’m considering how. You can already add your Recommendations to a new page using a simple shortcode. See the <a href="https://help.micro.blog/t/recommendations/2671">documentation</a> for details. Perhaps it would be a side menu if enabled. I’m not certain yet.</p>

			 <p>I know I have notes scattered all over in various apps. Evernote, Bear, Ulysses, Apple Notes, Reflect, Mymind, and Obsidian to name a few.</p>
<p>Since I never know where a note is, I don&rsquo;t use them often and even create duplicate notes because if forget where it is or forget I already have the note.</p>
<p>I want to consolidate them into one place.</p>
<p>But where?</p>
<p>Currently, I&rsquo;m strongly considering Obsidian, but I need to sit on that for a while. I have a strange relationship with Obsidian. Every time I look at it fresh, I remember how powerful it is and possible to organize any way I want. But then I use it for a while and quickly get frustrated for one reason or another.</p>

			 <p>I like how <a href="https://agenda.com/">Agenda</a> handles their subscription model.</p>
<p>You can subscribe and get all the features of the app up to that point. You can let your subscription run out and you no longer get updates, but you keep all the features you already had.</p>
<p>You only need to keep your subscription going to get new features or to support the developer.</p>
<p>I wonder how challenging it is to manage on the backend. It seems like a good approach.</p>

			 <p>Thanks to the latest Micro.blog <a href="https://www.manton.org/2024/02/21/simplified-pricing-in.html">subscription changes</a>, I decided to split my blog into 3 sites.</p>
<ul>
<li>My main <a href="https://ericgregorich.com">blog</a> will remain as is.</li>
<li>The <a href="https://cards.ericgregorich.com">Cards Theme</a> now has its own blog. Updates are still posted to my main timeline. It has its own <a href="https://cards.ericgregorich.com/feed.xml">RSS feed</a> and <a href="https://cards.ericgregorich.com/newsletter/">newsletter</a>.</li>
<li>The <a href="https://thepowerarchitect.com">Power Architect</a> is where I post about the Microsoft Power Platform. Updates are posted to my other account <a href="https://micro.blog/thepowerarchitect">@thepowerarchitect</a>. This allows me to post freely with niche content without cluttering up my main feed. It has its own <a href="https://thepowerarchitect.com/feed.json">RSS feed</a> and <a href="https://thepowerarchitect.com/newsletter/">newsletter</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Something always nagged at me when trying to combine everything into one site. I didn&rsquo;t want to have different services for different things (it gets expensive). This solves that problem by allowing me to have everything under one account, but still separate the content. Thanks, <a href="https://micro.blog/manton">@manton</a>!</p>
<p>Now that everything is in its place, I hope to start posting more content soon.</p>
<p>Please let me know if you have any suggestions!</p>

			 <p>The GUID is created using the computer’s network address, generating the GUID, the current date and time, and a random number.  GUIDs are often used as unique identifiers.</p>

<p>You can create your own GUID using an <a href="https://guidgenerator.com">online tool</a>, or your local development tools. You likely have a GUID function in your preferred development tool that will generate one for you.</p>

			 <p>I like the idea of creating static pages that I can continuously update over time.</p>

<p>Anyway, I created a new page. I decided to use my Obsidian Publish account since I still have an ongoing subscription. I think pages like this would be effortless to update from Obsidian. I may add more pages to that site, including a list of search engines, static site generators, favorite newsletters, podcasts, etc. Obsidian Publish should work well for &ldquo;static&rdquo; pages that are updated over time and independent of the chronological order of a blog.</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>I had an opportunity to do a demo of the <a href="https://www.apple.com/apple-vision-pro/">Apple Vision Pro</a> yesterday. The following is a write-up of my experience.</p>
<h2 id="the-demo">The Demo</h2>
<p>My store had a section blocked off with a couple of tables where a few people can do the demo all at the same time. It was a sitting experience and quite loud in the room, unfortunately. Not the ideal setup, because of the noise, and the other people in my “view”, but it probably didn’t deter the experience much.</p>
<h2 id="the-hardware">The Hardware</h2>
<p>Apple took my current glasses so they could add the appropriate lease to my demo device. While I waited, my guide talked to me about what to expect and her experience with her first demo.</p>
<p>The device itself is very slick. High-quality materials. A very premium looking piece of hardware. Exactly what you would expect from Apple.</p>
<p>I didn’t think much of the weight at first. I adjusted my straps and while I could tell the weight was in the front, it didn’t seem significant or uncomfortable. A 20-minute demo is not enough to know.</p>
<p>One of the things I didn’t think about until after the demo was the audio. There is nothing covering the ears. Yet, the audio sounded pretty good, even in a noisy room. Not the same as it would be with good headphones or a good living-room sound system, but impressive nonetheless.</p>
<h2 id="the-ui">The UI</h2>
<p>After some adjustments, the demo started. When things booted up, I was looking to the side and that is where my UI “stuck”. So, as I waited, I was looking elsewhere and didn’t even see the boot up sequence. Apparently, where you&rsquo;re looking when your Home Screen loads is where it will stay, until you move it.</p>
<p>I remember glancing to the side and noticing the Home Screen floating there, and then I realized what was happening. I adjusted.</p>
<p>The UI looks spectacular. It just floats there in front of you. It looks as if you can touch it. Everything has a “soft” look to it. The area you&rsquo;re looking at is crisper than the surrounding area, as in real life. This also makes it possible to put more processing power into the area you&rsquo;re looking at rather than what you&rsquo;re not.</p>
<p>As I look around with my eyes, the icons light up. It’s obvious your eyes are your primary navigation (without getting into the accessibility options).</p>
<p>Clicking a selected UI element is obvious. Tap your fingers together. I was initially holding my hands up when I did this, but realized that was not necessary. As long as my hands were not obstructed under the table, it worked just fine while resting.</p>
<p>There are other gestures for scrolling and zooming.</p>
<h2 id="the-environments">The Environments</h2>
<p>I was then guided through the UI and the “Environments” that could be enabled using your “Digital Crown” on the headset itself. You could fade the environment in and out. This allows you to sit in the Alaskan mountains, or a beach, while you work or play.</p>
<h2 id="photos-and-videos">Photos and Videos</h2>
<p>Next, I took a tour of some photos that were taken on various iPhones. Initially, they were standard photos that looked great. I could easily resize and zoom in and out. Next, were the spatial photos, which were taken from newer iPhones or the Vision Pro itself. These photos were much more realistic and had a depth to them that didn’t look “fake 3D” but more lifelike than any other photo I’ve seen.</p>
<p>I then experienced the video where I’m sitting at a table with the family watching the young girl blowing out her birthday cake candles. I think this was the first “oh wow” that came out of my mouth. Other than the limited field-of-view from the goggles, it really did feel like I was sitting there in the room.</p>
<p>After experiencing this, I genuinely understand why we would want to record these moments so that we may watch them again whenever we want. It was quite remarkable. On the other hand, I don’t envision myself wanting to wear a Vision Pro during these moments. Maybe recording with a phone instead. There needs to be a better way to record these moments without being taken out of the moment itself.</p>
<h2 id="movies">Movies</h2>
<p>Next, was a quick demo of the Mario movie. During which, I was able to resize the window to “Movie Screen” size and experience what is like to watch a movie with the Vision Pro. I could envision myself watching movies on this device. However, I think some movies are ideal for the Vision Pro, while some may not be. This <a href="https://youtu.be/eOH33sWgds8?si=Jrj_gfJNnQNfX0aT&amp;t=299">video</a> explains it well.</p>
<h2 id="the-recap">The Recap</h2>
<p>Last, was a 5-minute video that went through various landscapes, including mountain climbing, flying, interacting with rhinos, and a few other things.</p>
<p>I did back up when the Rhine came at me. I thought I could feel things slightly that were not really there, like the mist, or the cold rain. My mind was filling in the gaps. It was pretty cool.</p>
<h2 id="the-demo-ends">The demo ends</h2>
<p>This concluded my demo. I was a bit disappointed it ended so quickly. I was expecting to see some dinosaurs, touch a butterfly, and experience the mindfulness features. Not only that, but I didn’t experience Personas, or what it would be like to us a Mac, or take a Zoom call. Things I would expect to use in real-life.</p>
<h2 id="motion-sickness">Motion Sickness</h2>
<p>I’m someone who gets motion sickness easily. I can’t ride in the back seat of a car on long trips or ride rollercoasters. Yet, I didn’t have any problems at all with the Vision Pro. Sure, I may have felt a little unbalanced when I was suddenly on a high tight-rope looking over a river. But that’s part of the experience.</p>
<h2 id="long-periods">Long Periods?</h2>
<p>Could I use the Vision Pro for long periods of time? Could I use it to work on my computer? Read a book? Watch movies? I don’t know for sure. While the device was comfortable during the 20 minutes I was wearing it, I did notice I was very sweaty when I took it off. I would imagine it would get uncomfortable to use more than a couple of hours at a time.</p>
<h2 id="antisocial">Antisocial?</h2>
<p>A big issue I have with the Vision Pro is that it is primarily a solo experience. While you can, optionally, see other people in the room and interact with them, they won’t see what you see. What if I want to watch a show with my wife? Or a movie with my kids? I suspect this is something Apple will resolve over time. There will be more ways to have a shared experience, assuming each of you have a Vision Pro.</p>
<h2 id="will-i-buy-a-vision-pro">Will I buy a Vision Pro?</h2>
<p>I think I have the same reaction to the Vision Pro as most people. It’s technically outstanding, but it’s too expensive, and I don’t think I would use it enough.</p>
<p><strong>No, I won’t be buying this first version of the Apple Vision Pro.</strong></p>
<p>I will certainly be watching the next versions to see how Apple improves things. Make it a little lighter, a lot cheaper, and more capable (especially in multi-player) then it will be much more interesting for me.</p>
<p>As it stands, I don’t know if there are many benefits to the Vision Pro as a “productivity” device. Perhaps, it could be used to replace your expensive monitors. You can then easily take your setup with you, even to a coffee shop.</p>
<p>There are certainly some situations that sound as if they would be wonderful with the Apple Vision Pro. Between comfort and battery life, I don’t think it&rsquo;s quite there yet. I’m excited to see what it looks like in a couple of years.</p>

			<h1><a href="https://blog.ericgregorich.com/2024/02/17/thoughts-about-code.html">Thoughts about code comments</a></h1>
		

		<a href="https://blog.ericgregorich.com/2024/02/17/thoughts-about-code.html" class="u-url"><time class="dt-published" datetime="2024-02-17 12:18:58 -0400">Feb 17, 2024</time></a>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>For many years, I thought my code should be clean and easy to read, and therefore I don’t need to use comments. The code itself should be “self-documenting”.</p>
<p>Over time, my view on comments has changed. I’ve learned to appreciate comments in my solutions, especially when I’m not the only developer.</p>
<p>I’m currently reading <a href="https://micro.blog/books/9781732102200" title="A Philosohy of Software Design">A Philosophy of Software Design</a>, which has a section of the book dedicated to comments in your code. The author’s viewpoints aligned with my own.</p>
<h2 id="write-comments-first">Write comments first.</h2>
<p>I find it easier to write the comments for a new piece of code before writing the code. The comments would describe what the code needs to do. It’s purpose.</p>
<p>This acts as a guide while writing the code itself. It sets boundaries. If the code starts doing more than it was originally intended, perhaps it should be refactored.</p>
<p>If you don’t know what the comments should be until after you write your code, then perhaps you need to take a step back and understand what you&rsquo;re about to do before you attempt it.</p>
<p>Of course, your comments would be updated as you write the code to fill in the blanks and ensure accuracy. The “how” of writing code is often different from the “what”.</p>
<p>It’s helpful to go back and revise the comments during, and after, the code has been written.</p>
<h2 id="developers-should-not-have-to-read-the-code-to-understand-its-purpose">Developers should not have to read the code to understand its purpose</h2>
<p>As I briefly mentioned in the introduction, I had the mindset that the code should be “self documenting”. A new developer can open the code and read through line-by-line and understand what it does.</p>
<p>While, I agree the code should be clean and readable in that way, why not tell the developer in the comments what to expect instead of making them read through all the code directly? What if they don’t need to introduce changes to the code? They only need to know what it does so they can use it along with their code?</p>
<p>In retrospect, it seems cruel to make a future developer read, line-by-line, to figure out what the code is supposed to do when it can be summarized in a one paragraph comment.</p>
<h2 id="avoid-comments-for-comments-sake">Avoid comments for comments sake</h2>
<p>In this example, the comments are completely overkill. I used to write comments like this all the time. It thought I was being a “good developer”. But in reality, I was adding a lot of extra text that was completely unnecessary.</p>
<pre><code>// Take input of a and add it to the input of b and return the result.
// Parameters:
//	a: The first number to be added.
// 	b: The second number to be added.
static int AddNumbers(int a, int b)
{
	return a + b; // returns the sum of a + b
}
</code></pre>
<p>Instead, describe the purpose in a short, concise words. This function is so simple, it does not need additional comments to understand what it does.</p>
<pre><code>// Takes two input parameters and returns their sum.
static int AddNumbers(int a, int b)
{
	return a + b; 
}
</code></pre>
<h2 id="remove-any-code-that-is-commented-out">Remove any code that is commented out</h2>
<p>It drives me crazy when I look at some code and see 40 lines of code commented out because it is no longer being used. If we no longer require it, delete it!</p>
<p>I was guilty of this in the past. I didn’t want to lose previously written code, “just in case” we needed to refer to it. Or I wanted to keep a running history of changes.</p>
<p>This is what source control is for! You can safely delete it and still refer to it later. Your source control commits should explain the change history.</p>
<h2 id="comments-should-not-repeat-documentation">Comments should not repeat documentation</h2>
<p>There is a difference between comments and documentation. I believe comments should be close to the code with the purpose of helping the developer who is writing the code and also any future developers who are reading the code. It is a guide to what can be expected in the code that follows.</p>
<p>Documentation, on the other hand, describes the system at a higher level. Its audience consists of other roles, like architects, product managers, etc.</p>
<p>The comments in your code can link to related documentation, rather than repeating it.</p>
<p>The comments in your code should be an extension of your documentation, not a copy or replacement of it.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>So in 2023, I switched gears to emphasize <em>intimacy</em>. Instead of statistical analysis and summative interviews, I sat next to individuals for hours, as they used one-off prototypes which I’d made just for them. And I got more insight in the first few weeks of this than I had in all of 2022.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Andy&rsquo;s article makes me think about a significant project that involves getting a large organization to adopt standard processes.</p>
<p>Nearly every small team at this company has developed its own process to achieve the same goal over the years. Selling them a new way of doing things has been a chore.</p>
<p>Designing this overarching process has been a challenge. To Andy&rsquo;s point, spending time with individuals has been more beneficial than meeting in groups. It&rsquo;s more time-consuming and rewarding and often results in better information to use for the solution.</p>

			 <p>Your email address is an essential part of your identity. Your email address is used to log into your accounts, change your passwords, and more. Your email is also where you may have personal communication with others.</p>
<p>I trust Google, Microsoft, and Apple enough to take your email security seriously. They&rsquo;re incredibly secure. <strong>But there is a difference between security and privacy.</strong> These companies can not only see your email but track how you use your email and share information about you with 3rd parties.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We share your personal data with your consent or to complete any transaction or provide any product you have requested or authorized. We also share data with Microsoft-controlled affiliates and subsidiaries; with vendors working on our behalf; when required by law or to respond to legal process; to protect our customers; to protect lives; to maintain the security of our products; and to protect the rights and property of Microsoft and its customers. - <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Microsoft Privacy Statement<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
</blockquote>
<p>When you use your domain for your email address, you can use a dedicated email client or a service that specializes in email and is determined to take your privacy seriously. <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Fastmail<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Protonmail<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, and <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Hey for Domains<!-- raw HTML omitted --> are a few I&rsquo;ve tried. </p>
<p>Another advantage to using your domain for your email is you can easily change services or email clients without changing your email address. For example, I recently wanted to try Hey for Domains. I was using iCloud Domains. I went through the instructions to change my DNS settings for my domain, and a few minutes later, I was using Hey. A week later, I decided Hey may not be for me, and I switched to Protonmail. </p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->The downside to switching is that you may have to leave your email history behind. Check if your email service allows you to do a full email export so you can take your email with you!<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>My main point to all of this is that a custom domain is a step in the right direction to take control of your email privacy.</p>
<p>If you have any additional email services or privacy tips, please share!</p>

			 <p>Using Firefox, if you hold down the ALT key and use the scroll wheel on your mouse, it will navigate you back or forward in your browser. This seems like a good idea, but I&rsquo;ve been having problems with doing this unintentionally.</p>
<p>I have a unique scenario. I&rsquo;m developing Power Apps, and while in the editor, if you hold down your ALT key, it will change the app you editing to &ldquo;play&rdquo; mode so you can click around as if you were using the app.</p>
<p>If I hold down the ALT key to go into Play mode but then want to scroll in my app&hellip; well, you see the problem. Firefox navigates back to a previous screen, which closes my app altogether, and I lose all my changes.</p>
<p>Fortunately, I found a fix.</p>
<ul>
<li>Open Firefox.</li>
<li>Type <code>about:config</code> in the address bar.</li>
<li>Click the <code>Accept the Risk and Continue</code> button.</li>
<li>Search for <code>mousewheel.with_alt.action</code></li>
<li>Edit its value from <code>2</code> to <code>1</code>.</li>
</ul>
<p>This is all it took to fix my issue!</p>

			 <p>Looking back on 2023, I realize this blog has stuck around even as I jump from app to app and service to service. I attribute that to <a href="https://micro.blog/manton">@manton</a>&rsquo;s great work creating a solid platform and a fantastic community.</p>
<p>While I&rsquo;ve changed things a bit, including the theme and domain, the foundation remains. This blog is where I can post my thoughts, no matter how brief. I can post <a href="https://ericgregorich.com/categories/notes/">notes</a>, <a href="https://ericgregorich.com/categories/quotes/">quotes</a> I enjoy, <a href="https://ericgregorich.com/categories/links/">links</a> I find interesting, <a href="https://ericgregorich.com/categories/photos/">photos</a> of things I&rsquo;ve experienced, and even <a href="https://ericgregorich.com/categories/books/">books</a> I&rsquo;m reading.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll never go back to posting to social media or even creating a newsletter with the content starting here, where I own and control it.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s next?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not one to share much online; I started to break out of that shell in 2023. I plan to do more and see where it goes. I go to this site to find past notes nearly as often as I go to my actual notes app. I may embrace that and keep adding more content that I find helpful in hopes others find the same.</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>My productivity journey has been a rollercoaster of discovery and learning since 2002.</p>
<p>I was transitioning to be a developer in my day job and doing web design on the side. I was also starting a family, newly married, with a kid on the way.</p>
<p>My time was consumed with the number of tasks and projects coming at me. So, I did what any rational knowledge worker would do; I read &ldquo;Getting Things Done&rdquo; (GTD) by David Allen.</p>
<p>GTD changed my world! I was organizing my tasks and projects like a master.</p>
<p>But I still became burnt out. Some days, I would spend more time organizing my tasks, which made me feel accomplished instead of doing the work.</p>
<p>I started looking for other ways to become productive. The cycle would repeat. I would find a new productivity technique that would work for a while, but then I&rsquo;d not use it again.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s wrong with me?</p>
<p>Today, I have it mostly figured out.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not about the productivity technique you&rsquo;re using at all. It&rsquo;s about understanding many techniques and systems, as well as understanding your current situation and adapting the proper techniques to the situation.</p>
<p>One day, I may be working from a simple index card listing the tasks I want to complete, while another day, I&rsquo;m deep in Azure DevOps, planning the next sprint. I&rsquo;ll time-block some more significant tasks so they don&rsquo;t get overlooked by incoming &ldquo;urgent&rdquo; tasks. Sometimes, I use a Pomodoro timer to help me start on a frog (from the &ldquo;Eat That Frog&rdquo; technique) to stop procrastinating.</p>
<p>What works for me changes over time. It comes and goes in seasons. During a busy season, I need more reviews, stricter time blocking, and actively block distractions. During the slower seasons, I can be more flexible.</p>
<p>Would I do things differently if I were to start over?</p>
<p>I would still learn all the techniques and read all (okay, just a few) of the books I&rsquo;ve read over the years. I can attribute them to building the foundation I have today.</p>
<p>If I could go back in time and talk to my former self, I would tell him to keep going and learning but not dwell on things that don&rsquo;t work. Move on.</p>
<p>Also, being productive requires a healthy foundation. Get plenty of sleep, exercise, and family time. These things are more critical than I realized back then. They&rsquo;ve changed the way I work and help me be more productive overall.</p>
<p>The journey continues.</p>

			 <p>After dabbling with <a href="https://bearblog.dev">Bear Blog</a>, I&rsquo;ve decided to stick with Micro.blog. I liked what I saw with Bear Blog. Very simple and easy to use. Perhaps my biggest issue was the lack of external tools for posting (from what I could tell). Micro.blog&rsquo;s ability to handle short and long posts has me won over.</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>I’ve been using Hey to replace my RSS reader by using The Feed to limit what I consume.</p>
<p><img src="https://ericgregorich.micro.blog/uploads/2023/2095cd0f76.png" alt=""></p>
<p>My <strong><a href="https://hey.com">Hey</a></strong> subscription will run out in a couple of months. I was not using it for a while. I thought I would give it another go so I can decide if I keep it or not.</p>
<p>This time, I went all in with <strong>The Feed</strong>. A simple feature in Hey where you have a single page where all your newsletter-type emails go. You can then scroll through the feed, read as much as you want, and skip the rest.</p>
<p>I updated all of my newsletters to go into Hey. I eventually updated all of my RSS feeds and even YouTube subscriptions to go into Hey as a daily digest using <strong><a href="https://mailbrew.com/" title="Mailbrew">Mailbrew</a></strong>.</p>
<p>There are no read/unread flags or no message counts. In fact, can easily miss things if I don’t get to them during a reading session.</p>
<p>And that is okay.</p>
<p>One problem with a traditional RSS reader is that it feels more like another inbox that needs clearing. I’m the type to stay at Inbox Zero, so I’d be sure I didn’t miss anything.</p>
<p>The Feed in Hey doesn’t give me this same feeling (I think it took a couple of weeks to get over this.) I’m learning that I don’t need to read every post from every blogger I follow. Or see every video from every channel I subscribe to.</p>
<p>Another thing I enjoy about using <strong>The Feed</strong> is that I consume the content in the intended format. When using a traditional RSS app, everything is stripped of the formatting and presented with a clean wall of text. While this makes reading longer content pleasant, everything starts to blend, and the design many creators spend a lot of time working on is lost.</p>
<p>In The Feed, there is no text parsing. I read the content as it was designed. <sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup></p>

<p>Even if I don’t use Hey forever, if I were to go back to another application for RSS Feeds, I may have different expectations.</p>

Blogtrottr takes the RSS feed and sends any new content to your email. Simple!</p>
<p>In addition, Blogtrottr also lets you set up a daily digest. For those feeds that are very active, this is a great feature.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I think that the appeal of AI hits the same chord for many people looking at their notes. They want to have neatly compiled notes with clearly thought-out ideas that resonate with others. They want to be done with the hard work of writing their ideas down poorly 20,000 times until they come up with a single good idea that they can run with.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>People figure AI will do this for them, but if your notes are crap to begin with, the output of any AI will also be crap.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is a good reminder that while many apps are gaining AI superpowers, the LLMs can’t replace our thinking and ideas. Sure, they can help spark ideas and maybe some other use cases, but they won’t do the hard work for you. Especially when it comes to personal knowledge management. What’s the point of handling over your learning to AI? The real learning comes from doing the work to understand something and how it relates to other things, not by letting some software do it for you.</p>

			 <p>After giving iA Writer another brief go, I’m sticking with Ulysses.</p>
<p>Ulysses has a customizable writing experience, handles images well, has built-in grammar tools, and, most importantly, has seamless publishing to Micro.blog, where my sites are hosted.</p>
<p>These reasons make Ulysses the easiest to open up on mobile (which I’m doing now) or the Mac and start writing. If it’s something I want to share, I hit publish.</p>
<p>I’ve also tried Obsidian, Typora, and Reflect. Each has some excellent features, but from a writing and publishing perspective, none are as simple and reliable as Ulysses.</p>
<p>My biggest issue is that Ulysses is Mac and iOS only. If I want to write a blog post for <a href="https://thepowerarchitect.com" title="The Power Architect">The Power Architect</a>, I must do it from my Mac. Maybe that’s a better experience anyway.</p>
<p>As far as notes go, I’ve been dumping private notes into Apple Notes and everything else into Ulysses. Much of it gets posted to my blog. I’m not a big note taker lately.</p>

<p>Perhaps you’ve had the experience of reaching the end of a day on which you’d been unusually successful in getting your work done, or sticking to your fitness routine, but then instead of thinking “What a great day!”, you think: “That’s the kind of day I’m aiming for, and now it’s my job to make sure I keep on having more and more of them!” The result: you turned a potential source of easy delight into a source of further stress.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We obviously want to set up a life where we have more great days, but as Oliver points out, there is a line we can cross. It’s easy to get caught up in the pursuit of happiness rather than simply being happy.</p>

			 <p>I generally don’t like using task managers while I’m working. Adding tasks or jumping to specific projects is a chore. And assigning dates is usually the preferred way to indicate what’s next to work on. The biggest issue is that task managers are, by default, ugly and messy. But Things 3 is different.</p>
<p>I’ve been using Things 3 for my personal tasks for quite some time. But I’ve recently started using it for work tasks as well. I have a unique setup to make this work, since I use Windows while working. I’ll explain later.</p>
<p>Not only does Things 3 have a beautiful and simple UI, but to be able to simply start typing any view, project, or even task without even triggering a keyboard shortcut is a dream.</p>
<p>Adding tasks is also simple, hit the spacebar and start typing. Tab through the fields to assign dates and tags.</p>
<p>One of the most useful features for me is the tag filtering. It is helpful for batching related tasks together. I spend most of my time in the “Anytime” view with a tag filter enabled, so I can focus on knocking out related tasks.</p>
<p>One task manager that gives the Things 3 UI a run for its money is <a href="https://teuxdeux.com" title="TeuxDeux">TeuxDeux</a>. Which I also enjoy and use occasionally.</p>
<p>But, for now, I think Things 3 is the king of task management apps.</p>

<p>As I get older (now 47), maintaining my health has become more important than ever, and I&rsquo;ve been neglecting it recently. It could be worse, but it&rsquo;s certainly not great.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been focusing on improving several key health habits, including sleep, exercise, and nutrition.</p>
<p>One habit I hope will be beneficial is consistently monitoring my fitness. This includes tracking my weight, body fat, sleep, and other factors.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve tried calorie counting in the past, but it didn&rsquo;t stick. It was too much work. However, I believe that weighing myself every day or at least every few days would be manageable.</p>
<p>I started with a basic bathroom scale. It was rather mundane and required me to manually use my phone, which I usually don&rsquo;t have on hand when I&rsquo;m weighing myself, to open the health app and log my weight.</p>
<p>So, today, I decided to buy a &ldquo;smart&rdquo; scale. There were more options for these devices than I expected.</p>
<p>The most crucial feature, aside from measuring my weight, was that it needed WiFi sync to automatically synchronize with my phone without any effort on my part.</p>
<p>Being the person I am, I delved into the technical specifications of these scales and ended up buying one of the most expensive consumer options available, the <a href="https://www.withings.com/us/en/body-comp">Withings Body Comp</a>.</p>
<p>Now, I can not only weigh myself daily but also track all sorts of other metrics that I don&rsquo;t fully understand.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sure this scale will be like all the other gadgets I get excited about and purchase. It will undoubtedly change my life, until it doesn&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>But seriously, I&rsquo;m hoping to establish some basic habits that will help me stay in this world a bit longer.</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>📚 According to the book <a href="https://micro.blog/books/9781439144831">How to Read a Book by Mortimer J. Adler and Charles Van Doren</a>, there are four reading levels. Each level has a purpose and is stacked upon each other; in other words, you can’t complete a level without first completing the previous level. Most material we read, including books, papers, and articles, is not worth our time to read at all four levels. Instead, an Inspectional or maybe Analytical reading will suffice.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Elementary Reading is what we learn in elementary school and is the fundamentals of reading. It involves understanding the words we read, not necessarily what the author tries to say.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Inspectional Reading is the reading we do with a limited amount of time. It involves skimming the book to understand what key concepts are covered. This is a great way to determine if a book is worth the time for analytical reading. During Inspectional Reading, we understand the meaning of the Title, read through the table of contents, check the index, skim through the chapters, and do a general skim through the material. Next, if it is a difficult book, we should start with a superficial reading, reading from beginning to end without trying to make sense of things.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Analytical Reading is a thorough and complete reading of the material for fundamental understanding.</p>
<ol>
<li>Know what kind of book you are reading.</li>
<li>Summarize the whole book in as few words as possible.</li>
<li>Understand the significant parts of the book.</li>
<li>Figure out what the author’s problems were.</li>
<li>Locate the important words the author is using and determine the meaning of these words as used by the author.</li>
<li>Mark the most important sentences in the book.</li>
<li>Construct the basic arguments by finding them in the connection of sentences.</li>
<li>Figure out what the author’s solutions are.</li>
<li>You must be able to say “I understand” before you can agree or disagree with the author.</li>
<li>When you do disagree, do so reasonably.</li>
<li>Respect the differences between knowledge and personal opinion. When you disagree, be sure you can state why.
<ol>
<li>Is the author uninformed?</li>
<li>Is the author misinformed?</li>
<li>Is the author being illogical?</li>
<li>Is the author’s analysis incomplete?</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>Syntopical Reading occurs when we read multiple sources on the same topic and use them to create an even greater understanding of the material, compare the opinions of the authors, and form a deep understanding of the material.</p>
</li>
</ol>

<p>Look for wisdom, not facts. We’re not reading to just find random pieces of information. What’s the point of that? We’re reading to accumulate a mass of true wisdom—that you can turn to and apply in your actual life. - Ryan Holiday</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The purpose of reading a wide variety of book types is to gain a broader understanding of the world, not just to memorize facts. There&rsquo;s no need for us to become human encyclopedias.</p>
<p>The ability to make connections from a wide expanse of experience is what makes us better.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Pet Rock is a collectible toy made in 1975 by advertising executive Gary Dahl. Pet Rocks are smooth stones from Mexico&rsquo;s Rosarito Beach. They were marketed like live pets, in custom cardboard boxes, complete with straw and breathing holes. The fad lasted about six months, ending after a short increase in sales during the Christmas season of December 1975.</p>

<p>But simply abiding by the rules doesn’t make excellent writing — it makes conventional, unremarkable writing, the kind usually found in business reports, policy memos and research articles.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The article discusses how AI can be used for writing. While it may produce concise and clear content, it cannot yet evoke the emotional responses from readers that a skilled human writer can.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;This creep phenomenon applies directly to how we now relate to comfort, said Levari. Call it comfort creep. When a new comfort is introduced, we adapt to it, and our old comforts become unacceptable. Today’s comfort is tomorrow’s discomfort. This leads to a new level of what’s considered comfortable.&rdquo; (Michael Easter, The Comfort Crisis)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We&rsquo;re constantly getting comfortable with our lives. Each comfort replaces other comforts, and we get deeper and deeper into the comfort hole, making it harder to get out.</p>

<p>The biggest problem with changing tools is that it feels like progress. You suddenly feel like you’re getting something done, but you’re not. You’re merely shuffling deck chairs, but it feels like you’re making progress.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Curtis talks about how switching tools can feel productive. I’ve indeed fallen into this trap (and am still falling).</p>
<p>Focus on the system and not the tools. Track your problems and only switch tools after evaluating and making an informed decision.</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>Finished reading: <a href="https://micro.blog/books/9780593236604">Outlive</a> by Peter Attia, MD 📚</p>
<p>The book Outlive by Peter Attia, MD is a guide to learning and planning for a long, healthy life. It is very detailed and covers the science behind it, as well as providing actionable advice. <em><strong>This post includes some of my notes from the book and the author&rsquo;s other content.</strong></em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;There comes a point where we need to stop just pulling people out of the river. We need to go upstream and find out why they’re falling in. —Bishop Desmond Tutu</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Here&rsquo;s an example schedule of the recommended training from this book. This is the minimum time you need to spend to get the benefits that will extend your life. Of course, any exercise is better than none!</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<h2 id="objectives-strategies-and-tactics">Objectives, Strategies, and Tactics</h2>
<p>Simply seeing your physician every year for an annual physical is not enough. This only evaluates what’s happening with your health <em>now</em>. You need to be proactive if you want to live longer. If you want to play the long-game with your life, you need to start with your objective, then define a strategy, then define tactics.</p>
<p>Your <strong>objectives</strong> would inlude defining what you want to be able to do in your old age. Common examples include picking up and playing with grandchildren, walking your dog, not be in pain, etc.</p>
<p>You then reverse-engineer your objectives and create a <strong>strategy</strong>.  The strategy is the higher level approach to how you will achieve your goals. What will you learn, what ways will you approach the problems.</p>
<p>The <strong>tactics</strong> are the things you do day-to-day and week-to-week that will help you achieve your objective.</p>
<h2 id="insulin-resistance">Insulin Resistance</h2>
<p>Insulin resistance is a major contributor to cancer, Alzheimer&rsquo;s, heart disease, and other medical conditions. It occurs when the body&rsquo;s cells don&rsquo;t respond correctly to insulin, which results in too much glucose entering the muscles and organs.</p>
<p>Surprisingly, exercise is the most effective way to combat insulin resistance, not nutrition.</p>
<h2 id="zone-2-training">Zone 2 Training</h2>
<p>Zone 2 training involves low-intensity exercise that is active enough for you to have a conversation without running out of breath. It is typically 70-85% of your peak heart rate.</p>
<p>During Zone 2, most of the work is done by your &ldquo;slow-twitch&rdquo; muscles that are rich in mitochondria. The mitochondria are “the power plants of the cell” and Zone 2 training can help them use fat as fuel.</p>
<p>To benefit and improve your health, you need at least 3 hours of Zone 2 training per week, split into four 45-minute sessions.</p>
<h2 id="vo2-max-training">VO2 Max Training</h2>
<p>VO2 Max is the highest rate at which a person can use oxygen during strenuous exercise. It is an indicator of aerobic fitness and endurance performance.</p>
<p>Achieving VO2 Max can be done by working at maximum intensity for four minutes, followed by a four-minute rest period. Repeat this cycle four times per week and measure your VO2 Max annually to measure progress. Apple Health and other fitness trackers have built-in VO2 Max measurements, though they may be less accurate than tests you can get at a medical facility.</p>
<p>Having a VO2 Max below average doubles the risk of death, which is even greater than the risk posed by smoking.</p>
<p>If your new to exercising, focus on Zone 2 Training for 6 months before starting VO2 Max Training.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>VO2 Max is perhaps the most powerful marker for longevity. - Peter Attia, MD</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="strength-training">Strength Training</h2>
<p>Strength training increases muscle mass, which uses excess glucose. As we age, we lose muscle, so the more muscle mass we can build while we&rsquo;re younger, the more we&rsquo;ll have stored for our later years.</p>
<p>To maximize the benefits of strength training, perform exercises 3 days per week with a focus on grip strength. Examples of exercises that target concentric, eccentric, and isometric strength include farmer&rsquo;s carry, deadlifts, and more. Eccentric strength is especially important to prevent injuries, such as the ability to stop yourself from falling.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s also important to note that strength training is not effective if we don&rsquo;t consume enough protein in our diet. Aim for about 1g of protein per pound of total body weight per day (2.2g/kg/day).</p>
<h2 id="stability-training">Stability Training</h2>
<p>Stability is essential for training, as it helps to prevent injury and is necessary for strength and performance. When we lack stability, we might be strong, but we are wasting energy in the wrong places, such as joints and other muscles, which prevents us from reaching our full potential. <sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup></p>
<p>To ensure stability, dedicate 10-15 minutes of your day to stability training and one hour twice a week. Focus on Dynamic Neuromuscular Stabilization (DNS), which is based on natural movements.. <sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup></p>
<h2 id="nutrition">Nutrition</h2>
<p>When it comes to nutrition, there are some key principles to follow. One of them is getting enough protein. Protein is the most important macronutrient and we often don&rsquo;t consume enough of it. As we age, it becomes even more important to aim for 1g/lb/day (2.2g/kg/day) of protein, based on our current body weight. This should be spread out throughout the day, as excess protein can be converted into glucose.</p>
<p>In addition to protein, strive to eat healthy most of the time. Whole foods are preferable to processed food. However, the best approach is to monitor your own nutrition and adjust according to what works for you.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Getting nutrition wrong has far more negative consequences than getting it right. <sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="sleep">Sleep</h2>
<p>We need to sleep between 7 1/2 and 8 1/2 hours each night. Sleep deprivation can lead to insulin resistance. High stress can lead to poor sleep, which can further increase stress levels.</p>
<p>Studies show that sleeping less than 6 hours is associated with a 20% higher risk of heart attack. People who sleep less during middle age years are more likely to develop dementia later in life.</p>
<p>A couple of hours before bedtime, turn off unnecessary lights, especially LED, and replace blue lights with warmer colored lights. Get at least half an hour of sunlight during the day, which will also help with sleep. Keep your room and bed cool while sleeping.</p>
<h2 id="breathing">Breathing</h2>
<p>Breathing is essential for balance, motion, and power. It also reflects our emotional state. Long, slow breaths can suggest relaxation, while short, quick breaths can suggest anxiety.</p>
<p>An ideal inhalation engages the entire rib cage and abdomen simultaneously.</p>
<h2 id="mental-health">Mental Health</h2>
<p>Investigate Dialectical Behavior Therapy (DBT), a therapeutic approach designed to help people process trauma. It can also be beneficial for those with less severe emotional health concerns. <sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">4</a></sup></p>

			 <p>I&rsquo;ve always struggled to commit to using Apple Notes as my main notes app because it is difficult to get notes out. While some apps and tools are available to help with bulk exporting from Apple Notes, it still feels like a lock in. The other reason is, while I think Apple notes is great for capturing, I don&rsquo;t prefer to write in it. It&rsquo;s something about the layout, formatting options that bother me.</p>
<p>However, when I think about the way I use my note&rsquo;s app (at least how I want to use it) is as a scratchpad for capturing information that will be later transformed and shared as something new. When I think of it this way, I feel more comfortable with Apple Notes because I realize it is just a tool that I use to create the real value that is created and shared elsewhere. I could replace Apple Notes without needing to migrate all the content.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been using Ulysses to do all of my writing recently since, not only is it a great writing tool, but also great for publishing (to Micro.blog and Ghost in my case). I&rsquo;ll be trying Apple Notes for a while as my scratchpad where I throw ideas, sketches, bookmarks, and other things of interest. The fuel I need to create better content.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The concept of Personal Knowledge Management (PKM) is flawed in that it fails to recognize that there is more to knowledge management than simply collecting, storing, and organizing data. Rather, knowledge management is a process of transforming data into information and then into knowledge through the application of cognitive processes.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>While PKM tools can be helpful in collecting, organizing, and connecting the information you gather, it is up to you to do something with that information to turn it into knowledge.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>At the end of every weekday, I go through and color-code my calendar from the day that just finished.
Green = Energy Creating Yellow = Neutral Red = Energy Draining. I don’t spend too much time thinking about which bucket each item fell into—I try to trust my gut.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I like this idea of color coding the calendar to show what gives you energy vs. what drains your energy. It could be a great way to work on balancing things out. I&rsquo;m not sure I&rsquo;ll do it, but I&rsquo;ll keep it in mind.</p>

			 <p>I&rsquo;m about 90% complete with my &ldquo;website&rdquo; transition to Blot for hosting. The ONLY reason I&rsquo;m moving my main blog from Micro.blog is because of the workflow I have set up with Obsidian and Git.</p>
<p>Micro.blog is still where I post status updates and will continue to be the &ldquo;hub&rdquo; from a social standpoint.</p>

			 <p>I&rsquo;ve been quiet the past couple of weeks. I&rsquo;m working on a few things, including some website updates. I moved my Micro.blog site to <a href="https://blog.ericgregorich.com">blog.ericgregorich.com</a> and moved my <a href="https://ericgregorich.com">main site</a> to <a href="https://blot.im">Blot.im</a>.</p>
<p>The only reason for this move is because Blot fits my workflow better. I can take all my markdown notes in Obsidian and easily publish them to my website using Git. I have local markdown files for everything, which is my goal.</p>

<p>If you use your domain for your Micro.blog site, you can set up <a href="https://indieweb.org/How_to_set_up_web_sign-in_on_your_own_domain" title="web sign-in">web sign-in</a> with it. This will allow you to log into websites that support IndieAuth.</p>
<h2 id="configuring-your-links">Configuring your links</h2>
<p>This consists of adding links to your themes layouts/partials/head.html page, each with a rel=“me” tag.</p>
<p>Micro.blog handles Twitter, Github, and Instagram out of the box. You can update your username for these three default services from your <a href="https://micro.blog/account/apps">Micro.blog account</a>. Once added, if you look at the source of our blog, you’ll see the links as follows:</p>
<pre><code>&lt;link rel=&quot;me&quot; href=&quot;https://twitter.com/yourusername”  /&gt;
&lt;link rel=&quot;me&quot; href=&quot;https://github.com/yourusername&quot; /&gt; 
</code></pre>
<p>If you want to add more services, use the <a href="https://micro.blog/account/plugins/view/80" title="Meta tags">Meta tags plugin-in for Micro.blog</a> by <a href="https://micro.blog/manton">@manton</a>. Install the plug-in, open the settings, and add your custom links, as shown here. Add as many as you need, one per line.</p>
<pre><code>&lt;link rel=&quot;me&quot; href=&quot;https://{the site url}&quot;/&gt;
</code></pre>
<h2 id="validate-your-links">Validate your links</h2>
<p>Finally, validate on <a href="https://indiewebify.me/validate-rel-me">IndieWebify.me</a>. The validation will show you which URLs are set up on your site and if those URLs link back to your site.</p>
<h2 id="testing-your-links">Testing your links</h2>
<p>You can now go to <a href="https://indielogin.com/" title="Indielogin.com">IndieLogin.com</a> and enter your domain name to sign in. It will redirect you to the Micro.blog, where you’re prompted to approve the access request. You’ll be logged into the indieweb.org site using your domain if successful!</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>I stumbled across this <a href="http://richardcarter.com/sidelines/charles-darwins-note-making-system">article</a> by Richard Carter that describes how Charles Darin took notes.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If you were to keep a portfolio open for a couple of years, and throw in slips of paper as subjects crossed your mind, you would soon have a skeleton (and that seems to me the difficulty) on which to put the flesh and colours in your inimitable manner.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Darwin would mark up books, write literature notes, and even create a rough abstract of the books he read. He originally would use bound notebooks but later found them too restrictive, favoring the loose slips of paper instead.</p>
<p>The main takeaway is that he did not create a perfect system from the beginning, It always changed. The key is to capture notes and revisit them to create something useful.</p>
