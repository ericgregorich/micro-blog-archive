				"content_text": "<p>The Pomodoro Technique is a productivity hack where you set a timer for 25 minutes and then start a task and only work on that single task for 25 minutes. After the 25 minutes are up, you stop what you’re doing, take a 5-minute break, then start another 25-minute session. After 4 sessions, you take a longer break.</p>\n<p>Telling yourself you only need to work on a task for 25 minutes is a great way to get started. We often overcomplicate things in our mind and delay getting started.</p>\n<p>There are some downsides to the Pomodoro Technique. One is that you’re interrupted every 25 minutes. It may take you 20 minutes to get focused on the task, and then you’re interrupted by your timer. Should you take the break regardless? You could, but your break should be to step away, stretch, look out a window, grab some water, all the while you’re still thinking about your task. When you’re back to the task, you should (hopefully) be able to jump right back into it.</p>\n<p>You can create your own variations of the Pomodoro Technique. Try 55 minutes of work, 10-minute break.

				"content_text": "<p>I’ve had an off and on relationship with Obsidian for some time now. I want to love the app, but after using it for a period, I always end up frustrated, and I move to something else.</p>\n<p>I’ve started to use Obsidian in a way that works for me. More on that in a minute. First some venting.</p>\n<p>I don’t know exactly what it is that I don’t like about Obsidian.</p>\n<p>I think it’s the way you interact with files. It’s also the ugly search, file presentation, backlinks, and so many other things that irritate me. It all seems to work okay, but not for me. If I were to try to pinpoint a part of Obsidian that I don’t like, it’s the Organization of my content. It all makes sense in theory, but execution is where it gets me.</p>\n<p>Obsidian has failed me when I tried to use it as a Notes application. When I attempt to use it as a Capture tool, then make connections between notes, etc. All of that PKM jargon I’ve come to find pretty useless for me.</p>\n<p>The other thing that I have a love/hate relationship with is the Plugins. On one hand, Obsidian can be very overwhelming with everything that’s possible. On the other hand, I can make Obsidian work the way I want it to, by enabling or disabling third-party and core plugins.</p>\n<p>Now that the venting is out of the way, I’ll talk about how I started to use Obsidian and make it work for me.</p>\n<p>What I do love about Obsidian is that it is local-first. My files are simple Markdown text files that live on my computer. I can take them anywhere, and use them with other applications.</p>\n<p>I also like the writing experience in Obsidian, mostly. The Live Preview Markdown mode can be weird sometimes, but for simple writing, it’s pretty good.</p>\n<p>The other thing I’ve come to quite enjoy is how I can write something and publish to Micro.blog using the Micro Publish plugin. It’s pretty seamless. I can’t wait for image support!</p>\n<p>I now open Obsidian to a blank screen, which creates a new note in the Drafts folder. I use CTRL-N to create a new note. Then I write. When it’s ready, I publish. Then I drag that file to a folder named Posts, where I store my published content. I also have a Pages folder where I can keep Pages on my blog updated.</p>\n<p>If I need to find an existing note that I need to update, I use the built-in Quick Switcher (CTRL-O).</p>\n<p>That’s mostly it. I’m using Obsidian solely as a writing tool. And I find I’m truly enjoying it now.</p>\n<p>I have a few plugins that help me accomplish this:\n- <a href=\"obsidian://show-plugin?id=microblog-publish-plugin\">Micro Publish</a> : Post to Micro.blog. - <a href=\"obsidian://show-plugin?id=obsidian-focus-mode\">Focus Mode</a>: To toggle into focus mode where I only see the note itself - <a href=\"obsidian://show-plugin?id=obsidian-languagetool-plugin\">Language Tools</a>: Built in Grammar checking. - <a href=\"https://github.com/Akifyss/obsidian-border\">Border theme</a>: My favorite theme at the moment. - <a href=\"obsidian://show-plugin?id=obsidian-style-settings\">Style Settings</a>: For tweaking the Border theme to my liking.</p>\n<figure><img src=\"uploads/2024/myobsidianplugins.png\" alt=\"My Obsidian Plugins\" />\n<figcaption>My Obsidian Plugins</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<p>Here is a screenshot of what Obsidian looks like when not in Focus Mode.</p>\n<figure><img src=\"uploads/2024/obsidian-with-focusmode-disabled.png\" alt=\"My Obsidian with Focus Mode Disabled\" />\n<figcaption>My Obsidian with Focus Mode Disabled</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<p>And here with Focus Mode enabled.</p>\n<figure><img src=\"uploads/2024/obsidian-with-focusmode-enabled.png\" alt=\"Obsidian with Focus Mode enabled\" />\n<figcaption>Obsidian with Focus Mode enabled</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<p>I’m sure I’ll keep tweaking things now and then. That’s how I work. But overall, I’m loving the simplicity of this setup.</p>\n",

His latest, Slow Productivity, doesn't disappoint. </p>\n<p>Cal talks about three main aspects of slow productivity: do fewer things, work at a natural pace, and obsess over quality.</p>\n<p>The book is structured in a way that makes it easy to digest. There are three main parts; each part starts with a story. Next, Cal translates what it means for knowledge workers and then provides several action items that can help your situation. Finally, he goes into details and attempts to dispel any contradictions. </p>\n<p>If I were to rate the book on a 5-star system:</p>\n<p>- Importance of the topic: ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐</p>\n<p>- Structure of the book: ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐</p>\n<p>- Actionable Advice: ⭐⭐⭐</p>\n<p>If you already follow Cal's work, especially his podcast, Deep Questions, you're likely already familiar with the content in this book.

He would determine one or more keywords for an entry, then, in his index, find the first letter of the keyword, followed by the first vowel of the keyword.

				"title": "My thoughts about Hey Calendar",
				"content_html": "<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n",
				"content_text": "<p>I had a few days to play around with the new Hey Calendar from 37signals. Here is a <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iwTlm6UAFns\">4-minute video</a> of how it works.</p>\n<p>I give 37signals kudos for thinking outside the box. One thing they’ve done well with Hey email, for better or worse, is try to be original. An original UI/UX and some original features.</p>\n<p>They’ve coined the terms Imbox (for important email), The Feed (for newsletters), and Paper Trail (for receipts and paperwork you need to keep but don’t need to read).</p>\n<p>While in reality, these features are arguably just cosmetic, they did get me thinking about email differently.</p>\n<p>Hey Calendar is more of the same. The designers tried to think about how they use a calendar and developed an experience that worked for them.</p>\n<p>Does this translate well to every other user outside of 37signals?</p>\n<p>That’s debatable.</p>\n<p>When I go to Hey Email (and now Hey Calendar), I first think how nice and unique it is. The UI is clean and refreshing. But after using it for a few days, I tend to get frustrated and feel as if I’m being forced into someone else point of view with awkward navigation and location and naming of features.</p>\n<p>When I return to another email client, whether Fastmail, Apple Mail, Apple Calendar, or even Outlook, I think, “Wow, this is boring!” But you know what? It still works just fine. With a few filters/rules applied, I can get the same benefits of the Screener, Papertrail, and The Feed in any other email client.</p>\n<p>I do appreciate the attempts to add Habits and Time Tracking features to the initial release of Hey Calendar. Those two features should be built into every calendar service as core functionality. However, I found the initial implementation in Hey Calendar very limited.</p>\n<p><strong>The Week view</strong> in Hey Calendar makes sense to me. I tend to manage my week. But if I want to see the month ahead, it’s all right here; scroll a little.</p>\n<p><img style=\"display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\" title=\"HeyCalendarWeekView.png\" src=\"https://ericgregorich.micro.blog/uploads/2024/heycalendarweekview.png\" alt=\"A screenshot of the Hey Calendar Week View\" width=\"600\" height=\"334\" border=\"0\" /></p>\n<p><strong>The Day view</strong> takes some getting used to as it is horizontal. I had the Hey Calendar open on my small portable monitor below my primary monitor. It worked well as a dashboard showing my upcoming events. The screenshot below doesn’t do it justice since I’m not showing my actual calendar.</p>\n<p><img style=\"display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\" title=\"HeyCalendarDayView.png\" src=\"https://ericgregorich.micro.blog/uploads/2024/heycalendardayview.png\" alt=\"A screenshot of the Hey Calendar Day View\" width=\"599\" height=\"462\" border=\"0\" /> I found both the Week and Day views feel very cluttered when full of events, habits, time tracking, photos, etc. This bothered me.</p>\n<p>The iOS app also questioned whether I could handle this unique look and functionality whenever I wanted to view my calendar. It would certainly take some adjustment.</p>\n<p>I had to reach out to <strong>Hey support</strong> once because I broke my Hey Calendar link when I tried to link my account with my Hey for Domains account. They responded within minutes and had my account fixed within a few hours. I feel like their support is top-notch. I could be wrong.</p>\n<p>Overall, I think both Hey email and calendar are interesting, but I don’t know if it’s worth paying for another year’s subscription. I’m on the fence, to be honest. I’m not using the Hey service at all at the moment, but my subscription doesn’t run out until March.</p>\n<p>If you love the UI and can deal with the very opinionated nature of the founders of 37signals, then Hey may be a great fit for you.</p>\n",

Your email is also where you may have personal communication with others.</p>\n<p>I trust Google, Microsoft, and Apple enough to take your email security seriously. They’re incredibly secure. <strong>But there is a difference between security and privacy.</strong> These companies can not only see your email but track how you use your email and share information about you with 3rd parties.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>We share your personal data with your consent or to complete any transaction or provide any product you have requested or authorized. We also share data with Microsoft-controlled affiliates and subsidiaries; with vendors working on our behalf; when required by law or to respond to legal process; to protect our customers; to protect lives; to maintain the security of our products; and to protect the rights and property of Microsoft and its customers. - <a href=\"https://privacy.microsoft.com/en-us/privacystatement\">Microsoft Privacy Statement</a></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>When you use your domain for your email address, you can use a dedicated email client or a service that specializes in email and is determined to take your privacy seriously. <a href=\"https://www.fastmail.com/\">Fastmail</a>, <a href=\"https://proton.me/mail\">Protonmail</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.hey.com/domains\">Hey for Domains</a> are a few I’ve tried. </p>\n<p>Another advantage to using your domain for your email is you can easily change services or email clients without changing your email address. For example, I recently wanted to try Hey for Domains. I was using iCloud Domains. I went through the instructions to change my DNS settings for my domain, and a few minutes later, I was using Hey. A week later, I decided Hey may not be for me, and I switched to Protonmail. </p>\n<p><strong>The downside to switching is that you may have to leave your email history behind. Check if your email service allows you to do a full email export so you can take your email with you!</strong></p>\n<p>My main point to all of this is that a custom domain is a step in the right direction to take control of your email privacy.</p>\n<p>If you have any additional email services or privacy tips, please share!</p>\n",

It’s easy to get caught up in the pursuit of happiness rather than simply being happy.</p>\n",

				"content_text": "<p>I generally don’t like using task managers while I’m working. Adding tasks or jumping to specific projects is a chore. And assigning dates is usually the preferred way to indicate what’s next to work on. The biggest issue is that task managers are, by default, ugly and messy. But Things 3 is different.</p>\n<p>I’ve been using Things 3 for my personal tasks for quite some time. But I’ve recently started using it for work tasks as well. I have a unique setup to make this work, since I use Windows while working. I’ll explain later.</p>\n<p>Not only does Things 3 have a beautiful and simple UI, but to be able to simply start typing any view, project, or even task without even triggering a keyboard shortcut is a dream.</p>\n<p>Adding tasks is also simple, hit the spacebar and start typing. Tab through the fields to assign dates and tags.</p>\n<p>One of the most useful features for me is the tag filtering. It is helpful for batching related tasks together. I spend most of my time in the “Anytime” view with a tag filter enabled, so I can focus on knocking out related tasks.</p>\n<p>One task manager that gives the Things 3 UI a run for its money is <a title=\"TeuxDeux\" href=\"https://teuxdeux.com\">TeuxDeux</a>. Which I also enjoy and use occasionally.</p>\n<p>But, for now, I think Things 3 is the king of task management apps.</p>\n",

				"content_text": "<p><a href=\"https://teuxdeux.com/\">TeuxDeux</a> has been my go-to tool for managing both my work and personal tasks, along with some weekly planning. The interface is clean and straightforward, presenting a weekly view with customizable lists underneath.</p>\n<p><img src=\"uploads/2023/screenshot-of-teuxduex.png\" alt=\"A screenshot of my TeuxDeux setup.\" width=\"650\" height=\"432\" /></p>\n<p>I typically keep the application active on my secondary, smaller screen, which is positioned beneath my primary widescreen monitor. It serves as an excellent dashboard, enabling me to quickly glance at upcoming tasks and record notes and tasks.</p>\n<p>TeuxDeux also provides some advanced features, such as recurring tasks, simple markdown, color coding, and the ability to create tasks via email. Additionally, there is an app available for both iOS and Android.</p>\n<p>I usually plan my week by manually adding any calendar events into TeuxDeux and color coding them. I use green to signify client meetings, yellow for internal meetings, and blue for personal events.</p>\n<p>Although there is no direct connection to a calendar, I am comfortable with this setup. I enjoy planning my week in this manner. I prefer time blocking in TeuxDeux because when I attempt to block time on my actual calendar, I constantly need to rearrange it, which makes my calendar feel cluttered.</p>\n<p>I don’t usually put much in the daily blocks, instead, I work from the lists at the bottom. An exception is when a task must be completed on a specific day, and my calendar events.</p>\n<p>I have separate tabs for Personal, Work, Wish Lists, and Someday. Each tab contains a few lists. My Personal and Work lists serve as my contexts (Admin, Chores, Research, Development, etc.)</p>\n<p>I believe TeuxDeux may be one of the simplest task management apps I’ve used. It’s like having a large sheet of paper in front of me. I absolutely love it!</p>\n<p>Here is a quick introduction video from the founder.</p>\n<p><iframe title=\"YouTube video player\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/1irwJNRSs14?si=TgrrcwR63IiRV2si\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe></p>\n",

AI Search, like Chat-GPT and others are using Large Language Models are extracting and manipulating the given text to try and give you the correct answer. Although, it is technically impressive, there is no real “intelligence” here.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h2 id=\"howdoesitwork\">How does Evernote AI Search work?</h2>\n<p>Evernote AI Search operates by initially generating a standard search that gathers the notes potentially containing the answer to your question. These notes are then forwarded to a third party (currently OpenAI), where the answer is returned along with a list of relevant notes.</p>\n<p>You also have the option to request all notes from a specific date range, with particular tags, within certain notebooks, and/or that match given keywords. Your question is sent to OpenAI, and the appropriate Evernote advanced search syntax is returned. You will then see all the notes that match your query. This adds a natural language layer to Evernote’s advanced search, which is quite beneficial, especially since it does not send your notes to a third party in this scenario.</p>\n<h2 id=\"isittrustworthy\">Is Evernote AI Search trustworthy?</h2>\n<p>Evernote does a good job of telling you exactly what you’re getting into. Not all of your notes are sent to OpenAI, only those relevant to the search, and they are automatically deleted from their servers after 30 days. If you’re not comfortable with this, don’t use it!</p>\n<p>You can still use Evernote with regular search without the AI.</p>\n<p>I wish there were a toggle to hide it from the UI altogether.</p>\n<p>I think Evernote needs to add more options to allow users to tag notebooks, tags, or specific notes that will never be sent to the AI.</p>\n<h2 id=\"evernoteaisearchcanhelpyoufindanswersmaybe.\">Evernote AI Search can help you find answers, maybe.</h2>\n<p>If we store notes, PDFs, images, etc. for reference, this AI search could be extremely useful for quickly finding what we need.</p>\n<p>However, when I tested these AI queries, I did not get the results I expected. I thought that the question “When did I last change my oil in the Honda?” would find the receipts I have for my oil changes and return an answer with the date of my last oil change. Instead, all I received was a response stating that the information was not available, followed by a list of notes that matched some of the words I used in my query, most of which were far off. A regular search yielded better results.</p>\n<p><img style=\"display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\" title=\"Screenshot showng results from Evernote AI Search.png\" src=\"https://ericgregorich.micro.blog/uploads/2023/screenshot-showng-results-from-evernote-ai-search.png\" alt=\"Screenshot showng results from Evernote AI Search\" width=\"228\" height=\"600\" border=\"0\" /></p>\n<p>I then ran the exact same query again and it found the answer (based on my latest receipt in Evernote).</p>\n<p><img style=\"display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\" title=\"Screenshot of Evernote AI finding an answer.png\" src=\"https://ericgregorich.micro.blog/uploads/2023/screenshot-of-evernote-ai-finding-an-answer.png\" alt=\"Screenshot of Evernote AI finding an answer\" width=\"372\" height=\"280\" border=\"0\" /></p>\n<p>I ran it yet again, and it failed to find the answer. Apparently, like any other LLM, its not consistent.</p>\n<p><img style=\"display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\" title=\"Screenshot of Evernote Search without the answer.png\" src=\"https://ericgregorich.micro.blog/uploads/2023/screenshot-of-evernote-search-without-the-answer.png\" alt=\"Screenshot of Evernote Search without the answer\" width=\"347\" height=\"192\" border=\"0\" /></p>\n<p>I created a new note that contains the written answer. However, even after 30 minutes, this note has yet to appear in my regular search results. Frustrating!</p>\n<p>From my observations, the more descriptive your notes are, the easier it is for AI to find the answer. This feature still relies on Evernote search, which is generally excellent, but not perfect.</p>\n<p>I found the same results with some of my other tests. Some tests worked just fine.</p>\n<p>With that said, I feel like if you spend the time to make your notes better, then they’re even easier to find with regular search. Is the AI Search worth it?</p>\n<h2 id=\"evernoteaisearchdoesnthelpusbuildknowledge\">Garbage In, Garbage Out</h2>\n<p>Another concern of mine is how some people may want to use this AI Search feature. Evernote is known as a place where you can capture anything, and it accumulates over the years. While the AI search can help extract specific content from this collection, it’s not addressing the main issue.</p>\n<p>Another popular service, Readwise, is an excellent tool for capturing highlights from books, articles, podcasts, videos, tweets, etc. Since Readwise can automatically export to Evernote, this makes Evernote’s AI Search even more powerful.</p>\n<p>The problem I have with this is that it skips the most important step, your thinking! If we blindly capture everything we find interesting, knowing that we’re building a giant repository of all this information, and Evernote will make it easy to find it again, are we getting real value out of this or are we simply creating our own personal search engine?</p>\n<p>There is certainly some value there, but if your goal is to become a better thinker, then I’m guessing the act of thinking may need to be involved at some point during the process.</p>\n<h2 id=\"williuseevernoteaisearchorevernoteatall\">Will I use Evernote AI search (or Evernote in general?)</h2>\n<p>While Evernote has certainly been through tough times recently, I believe the service is better than it has ever been. The apps are quick and efficient. Sync also seems to be reliable after recent updates.</p>\n<p>I’ve had an active Evernote account for many years. However, I haven’t been actively using Evernote for a while. I’m likely to let my account expire this year, particularly after the significant price increases.</p>\n<p>If you’re looking for an all-in-one tool that can store anything and you’re okay with all of your data being stored in a single service, then Evernote is still a good option. If you want a tool to help you learn and think, or just want to control your data locally, then I would recommend looking elsewhere.</p>\n<p>I don’t mean this to be a dig on Evernote. I actually think its a great service and hopefully has a bright future. I simply don’t think its for me, at least not today.</p>\n",

				"content_text": "<p>I've been a long-time user of Kindle and Audible, with a few physical books thrown in here and there in an attempt to determine my preference between physical or digital formats. I think the truth is that I like both, as each has its advantages.</p>\n<p>Digital is convenient.</p>\n<p>There is no doubt that the ability to pull up a book on my phone from anywhere to continue reading is very convenient.</p>\n<p>However, this convenience comes at a cost.</p>\n<p>Digital formats make it easy to blindly highlight and bookmark without revisiting. Then services, like Readwise, absorb those highlights and compile them into a massive personal database of all your highlights.</p>\n<p>In theory, this is extremely helpful. Some people undoubtedly couldn't manage any other way. They process these highlights as if there's no tomorrow and make connections to all their other notes.</p>\n<p>However, this method is not for me.</p>\n<p>I tend to get caught up in the \"system\" and lose the enjoyment of reading.</p>\n<p>I've also experienced this with podcasts. I was using the Snipd podcast player for a while, thinking I would create highlights of interesting things. The app works great, as it has some AI to make snipping highlights from audio easy.</p>\n<p>However, I found that listening to a podcast had become a chore.</p>\n<p>While there are no guarantees that I won't go down that road again, I'm currently stepping back and using physical books for a while.</p>\n<p>This doesn't mean I won't be taking notes on my books. I'm using Cal Newport's method of marking up a book. It involves simply making a mark in the corner of a page that has something useful and adding a line next to the paragraph.</p>\n<p>The purpose of this approach is more about making the content easy to revisit when I need it (if ever), rather than trying to process everything I find interesting into my system.</p>\n<p>This is something I've been calling \"Just In Time Note Taking\". I essentially bookmark what I find interesting so I can get back to it later if I ever need it. This contrasts with \"Just In Case Note Taking\", where I take notes on everything right away, which is very time-consuming and often unnecessary.</p>\n<p>Back to reading!</p>\n",

				"content_html": "<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n",
				"content_text": "<p>I’ve been reflecting on what I like about the <a href=\"https://reflect.app\">Reflect.app</a>. I’ve been using the app for a couple of weeks, experimenting with it to determine if it’s something I want to use long-term.</p>\n<p>I think the main thing is its simplicity. It feels like a minimal app. In fact, when I started using it, I thought it felt incomplete somehow. The lack of buttons and menus threw me off.</p>\n<p>Yet, as I used it, I felt as though it had just the right amount of features to make it a quite powerful tool for writing.</p>\n<p>At first glance, Reflect looks like an outliner, where each line is a block, similar to Roam Research or Logseq. However, Reflect is not an outliner. While the daily note page defaults to use bullets, they’re not required. In fact, when you create a new note, you start with a simple blank page with a title. I love this!</p>\n<p>The main features that attracted me to Reflect are the focus on speed and reliability, end-to-end encryption, and import and export capabilities. But, there are many more features, including templates, calendar integration, Kindle Sync, Readwise Integration, Tasks (beta), and they recently added very robust AI integration. They accomplished all of this without adding any clutter to the app, which I appreciate.</p>\n<p>I’ve also been trying the AI integration to see how I could use it. It works great for cleaning up meeting notes, creating lists, counterarguments, and even fixing grammar and spelling. I’m not a big AI user, but its helpful to be able to clean up my notes.</p>\n<p>There is also an iOS app in beta that is quite solid. It doesn’t have many features yet, but it works great for finding and editing notes.</p>\n<hr />\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://reflect.academy\">Reflect Academy</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://reflect.app/changelog\">Changelog</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://roadmap.reflect.app\">Roadmap and Feature Requests</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://reflect.app/download\">Download Reflect</a></li>\n</ul>\n",

I also use it to highlight and take notes, which automatically sync to Readwise.</p>\n<p>The Reader app has grown on me over time. It is much more powerful than most similar services. Having RSS, videos, and my “Read Later” all in one place has been convenient.</p>\n<p>I also use the Reader as my external reference. If I want to look up information about a topic that I want to write about, or I need to reference documentation, I search in the Reader, and it pops right up. I don’t need to use external tools.</p>\n<h2 id=\"snipd\">Snipd</h2>\n<p>I use Snipd for my podcasts due to its unique feature of creating clips from podcasts, which can be AI-generated or manually adjusted. These clips sync automatically to Readwise.</p>\n<h2 id=\"kindleaudible\">Kindle/Audible</h2>\n<p>I mostly read on Kindle and Audible, often using the immersive reading feature to listen and read simultaneously for better focus. Of course, all my highlights and notes are synced to Readwise.</p>\n<h2 id=\"readwise\">Readwise</h2>\n<p>All content is synced into Readwise where I occasionally review my notes and highlights. Instead of exporting everything to another tool such as Obsidian or Reflect, I prefer keeping them in Readwise to separate others’ content from mine.</p>\n<h2 id=\"reflect\">Reflect.app</h2>\n<p>I’m testing <a href=\"https://reflect.app\">Reflect.app</a>, drawn in by its simple interface, daily notes, calendar integration, end-to-end encryption, local-first approach, and advanced AI. If the experiment proves successful, it could potentially replace Ulysses and even Grammarly as my primary writing tools.</p>\n<p>The objective is to create a library of reusable content that I can utilize for documentation, emails, estimates, development, code snippets, essay writing, and much more. I don’t subscribe to the “Zettelkasten” method per se. I just want a repository of content I create.</p>\n<h2 id=\"onthechoppingblock\">On the chopping block</h2>\n<h3 id=\"raindrop\">Raindrop</h3>\n<p>I’m still using Raindrop for bookmarks. I use it less though since Readwise Reader has taken over as my reference for external content. I still bookmark interesting apps, blogs, and other sites that I enjoy. I plan to start capturing those in Reflect and see if that works as a replacement.</p>\n<p>Bookmarks for “launching” things can easily be kept in my browser.</p>\n<h3 id=\"grammarly\">Grammarly</h3>\n<p>I’ve used Grammarly for years but canceled my subscription last month (effective today I discovered as I write this :)).</p>\n<p>I use Microsoft Editor for work, which is not as good as Grammarly but is integrated into most Microsoft tools.</p>\n<p>I’ve shifted from Grammarly to other AI tools like Reflect, which has built-in grammar checking, making the $144 annual Grammarly fee harder to justify.</p>\n<h3 id=\"feedbin\">Feedbin</h3>\n<p>I enjoy using Feedbin for its RSS reading due to its simple UI and adequate features.

I’ve indeed fallen into this trap (and am still falling).\n\nFocus on the system and not the tools. Track your problems and only switch tools after evaluating and making an informed decision. \n",

This only evaluates what’s happening with your health <em>now</em>. You need to be proactive if you want to live longer. If you want to play the long-game with your life, you need to start with your objective, then define a strategy, then define tactics.</p>\n<p>Your <strong>objectives</strong> would inlude defining what you want to be able to do in your old age. Common examples include picking up and playing with grandchildren, walking your dog, not be in pain, etc.</p>\n<p>You then reverse-engineer your objectives and create a <strong>strategy</strong>.  The strategy is the higher level approach to how you will achieve your goals. What will you learn, what ways will you approach the problems.</p>\n<p>The <strong>tactics</strong> are the things you do day-to-day and week-to-week that will help you achieve your objective.</p>\n<h2 id=\"insulin-resistance\">Insulin Resistance</h2>\n<p>Insulin resistance is a major contributor to cancer, Alzheimer&rsquo;s, heart disease, and other medical conditions. It occurs when the body&rsquo;s cells don&rsquo;t respond correctly to insulin, which results in too much glucose entering the muscles and organs.</p>\n<p>Surprisingly, exercise is the most effective way to combat insulin resistance, not nutrition.</p>\n<h2 id=\"zone-2-training\">Zone 2 Training</h2>\n<p>Zone 2 training involves low-intensity exercise that is active enough for you to have a conversation without running out of breath. It is typically 70-85% of your peak heart rate.</p>\n<p>During Zone 2, most of the work is done by your &ldquo;slow-twitch&rdquo; muscles that are rich in mitochondria. The mitochondria are “the power plants of the cell” and Zone 2 training can help them use fat as fuel.</p>\n<p>To benefit and improve your health, you need at least 3 hours of Zone 2 training per week, split into four 45-minute sessions.</p>\n<h2 id=\"vo2-max-training\">VO2 Max Training</h2>\n<p>VO2 Max is the highest rate at which a person can use oxygen during strenuous exercise. It is an indicator of aerobic fitness and endurance performance.</p>\n<p>Achieving VO2 Max can be done by working at maximum intensity for four minutes, followed by a four-minute rest period. Repeat this cycle four times per week and measure your VO2 Max annually to measure progress. Apple Health and other fitness trackers have built-in VO2 Max measurements, though they may be less accurate than tests you can get at a medical facility.</p>\n<p>Having a VO2 Max below average doubles the risk of death, which is even greater than the risk posed by smoking.</p>\n<p>If your new to exercising, focus on Zone 2 Training for 6 months before starting VO2 Max Training.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>VO2 Max is perhaps the most powerful marker for longevity. - Peter Attia, MD</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h2 id=\"strength-training\">Strength Training</h2>\n<p>Strength training increases muscle mass, which uses excess glucose. As we age, we lose muscle, so the more muscle mass we can build while we&rsquo;re younger, the more we&rsquo;ll have stored for our later years.</p>\n<p>To maximize the benefits of strength training, perform exercises 3 days per week with a focus on grip strength. Examples of exercises that target concentric, eccentric, and isometric strength include farmer&rsquo;s carry, deadlifts, and more. Eccentric strength is especially important to prevent injuries, such as the ability to stop yourself from falling.</p>\n<p>It&rsquo;s also important to note that strength training is not effective if we don&rsquo;t consume enough protein in our diet. Aim for about 1g of protein per pound of total body weight per day (2.2g/kg/day).</p>\n<h2 id=\"stability-training\">Stability Training</h2>\n<p>Stability is essential for training, as it helps to prevent injury and is necessary for strength and performance. When we lack stability, we might be strong, but we are wasting energy in the wrong places, such as joints and other muscles, which prevents us from reaching our full potential. <sup id=\"fnref:1\"><a href=\"#fn:1\" class=\"footnote-ref\" role=\"doc-noteref\">1</a></sup></p>\n<p>To ensure stability, dedicate 10-15 minutes of your day to stability training and one hour twice a week.

One of them is getting enough protein. Protein is the most important macronutrient and we often don&rsquo;t consume enough of it. As we age, it becomes even more important to aim for 1g/lb/day (2.2g/kg/day) of protein, based on our current body weight. This should be spread out throughout the day, as excess protein can be converted into glucose.</p>\n<p>In addition to protein, strive to eat healthy most of the time. Whole foods are preferable to processed food. However, the best approach is to monitor your own nutrition and adjust according to what works for you.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Getting nutrition wrong has far more negative consequences than getting it right. <sup id=\"fnref:3\"><a href=\"#fn:3\" class=\"footnote-ref\" role=\"doc-noteref\">3</a></sup></p>\n</blockquote>\n<h2 id=\"sleep\">Sleep</h2>\n<p>We need to sleep between 7 1/2 and 8 1/2 hours each night. Sleep deprivation can lead to insulin resistance. High stress can lead to poor sleep, which can further increase stress levels.</p>\n<p>Studies show that sleeping less than 6 hours is associated with a 20% higher risk of heart attack. People who sleep less during middle age years are more likely to develop dementia later in life.</p>\n<p>A couple of hours before bedtime, turn off unnecessary lights, especially LED, and replace blue lights with warmer colored lights.

				"content_html": "<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n",
				"content_text": "<p>I’ve been a longtime user of RSS feeds, and therefore Feed Readers, such as Google Reader back in the day. I’ve gone from Google Reader to Feedly and in the past couple years have bounced around from various services such as Inoreader, Feedbin, and others.</p>\n<h2 id=\"hundredsoffeeds\">Hundreds of feeds</h2>\n<p>As a result, I’ve accumulated hundreds of feeds over the years. And keeping up with them has been a hassle. In fact, I felt an urge every day to process all of my feeds, like I do with an email inbox. This resulted in unnecessary anxiety. Sounds stupid, but that’s life.</p>\n<h2 id=\"startingover\">Starting over</h2>\n<p>So, a couple of months ago, I thought I would drop all of my feeds and only subscribe back to the few that I actually miss. This helped tremendously. I’m back to a handful of new items every day that I can easily get through in one sitting.</p>\n<h2 id=\"therules\">The rules</h2>\n<p>In an attempt to keep myself from over subscribing, I try to follow a few rules.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Follow people, not organizations. This means no feeds from big companies, like Microsoft, Google, Apple, and the big news companies like The Verge. There is simply too much noise.</li>\n<li>Add new feeds to a special folder, which I review periodically. If the content is not providing value, I unsubscribe. If I enjoy it, I’ll move it to my main folder. This gives me a chance to follow a few new sources and see how they hold up.</li>\n<li>If I can’t get through my feeds in 30 minutes or less, then I need to start purging again.</li>\n</ol>\n<h2 id=\"theemailinboxforrss\">The email inbox for RSS?</h2>\n<p>I also tried using email instead of a feed reader. In this case, I subscribed to more newsletters and used Blogtrottr to send RSS feeds to my email every day. It was nice in that I could create a daily digest of some feeds.</p>\n<p>I decided I definitely want to keep the content I wish to read separate from my email. Mixing them was a mess.</p>\n<p>I stopped doing this.</p>\n<h2 id=\"youtubesubscriptions\">YouTube subscriptions</h2>\n<p>I also started adding all of my YouTube subscriptions to my RSS feeds. Subscribing to my favorite YouTube channels through RSS is a success. While it adds more feeds, it keeps me off the YouTube home page and lets me consume videos without the algorithm getting involved.</p>\n<h2 id=\"micro.blog\">Micro.blog</h2>\n<p>I also tried adding my Micro.blog feeds to my feed reader.</p>\n<p>While it’s useful to see my timeline in my RSS reader, it adds a lot of noise. Moreover, I enjoy using the Micro.blog app. I think it is set up in a way that lets me skim the latest and ignore the rest. It also gives me direct access to comments and the option to reply myself.</p>\n<p>Therefore, I no longer subscribe to my Micro.blog timeline through my feed reader.</p>\n<h2 id=\"whati’musing\">What I’m using</h2>\n<p>I’m currently using <a title=\"Reeder\" href=\"https://www.reederapp.com\">Reeder</a> on iOS as my feed reader, and I’m enjoying it.</p>\n<p>There are also a few newsletters that don’t provide RSS that I subscribe to. I use <a title=\"Kill The Newsetter\" href=\"https://kill-the-newsletter.com\">Kill the Newsletter</a> to convert these emails into an RSS Feed. It works flawlessly, and it’s free.</p>\n",

Export my Raindrop bookmarks as an HTML file. Import the HTML file into Anybox. It even kept all of my tags.</p>\n<p>It seems that Anybox has more options and more native apps on the Mac and iOS, although Raindrop’s new iOS app is pretty sweet. Anybox also has the ability to add standalone notes and files that I may utilize. It also appears to have a lot of automation capabilities that I may look into further.</p>\n<p>The biggest downside is that Anybox is not available on Windows. The way I have my current setup, that may not be a big deal. I have my Mac monitor below my Windows monitor and can easily switch back and forth throughout the day using Logitech flow.

I use this on my “Anytime” view in the mornings to browse all my tasks and decide what to focus on that day. A quick ctr-T sets the “When” date to today.</p>\n<p>I appreciate the ability to set tasks with actual deadlines, and the main “When” date is used to indicate when I plan to work on it.</p>\n<p>It’s a well-designed app that other apps could learn a lot from.</p>\n",

I then remembered UpNote. <a href=\"https://getupnote.com/\">UpNote</a> is a notes app I’ve tried in the past that is highly similar to Bear, but it is cross-platform and is updated frequently.</p>\n<p>I saw on my Mac that Upnote could work locally only without syncing your data. Perfect, I thought!</p>\n<p>I then installed UpNote on my Windows machine and, without logging in, started adding some notes. It worked flawlessly until…</p>\n<p>… I realized I need UpNote premium to use tables, have unlimited notes, export to PDF, and other critical features. No problem, I thought, because UpNote is dirt cheap, $24.99 for lifetime access. I thought it was worth the price.</p>\n<p>Next, I realized I couldn’t pay for a premium license without an account (a limitation in the Windows app). Understandable. So, I created an account and set it up on my Mac.</p>\n<p>I then switched to Windows, and it said my account was upgraded, and everything was good to go.</p>\n<p>Nope!</p>\n<p>I signed out of my account because I didn’t want to sync my work notes. I want it locally on my machine. As soon as I log out, my premium license is gone. You must be signed in and syncing data to have a premium license.</p>\n<p>What a bummer. I tried to give you money UpNote, but such a simple limitation is all it took to keep me on Obsidian at work.</p>\n<p>Regardless, I still highly recommend UpNote for anyone looking for something similar to Bear but is cross-platform. Remember that you can’t use Premium on Windows without syncing data.</p>\n",

It has enough space to hold plenty of equipment comfortably.</p>\n<h2>Monitors</h2>\n<p>I have an LG Ultrawide monitor with decent speakers, so I also use it for audio. I have a cheap standalone microphone velcroed to the back of the monitor. It works great.</p>\n<p>I have Windows running on the big monitor. This is where I do all my work for my day job. I also have a Mac mini for personal use.</p>\n<p>Until this week, both machines were connected to the main monitor. I would need to switch my monitor input to get to my Mac and vice-versa. </p>\n<p>The small monitor in the front is a recent purchase. It's an Arzopa 15” portable monitor (not an iPad). It allows me to see my Mac and Windows machines at the same time. I use my Mac for my email, calendar, notes, tasks, etc., and the big monitor for my work.</p>\n<p>The trick to making this work is using Logitech Flow. Since my keyboard and mouse are both Logitech, I can easily move my mouse between monitors by moving it to the edge of the screen while holding the CTR key. This works between Windows and Mac machines seamlessly. </p>\n<h2>Keyboard and Mouse</h2>\n<p>Logitech <a href=\"https://www.logitech.com/en-us/products/keyboards/mx-mechanical.html\">MX Mechanical Mini</a> and <a href=\"https://www.logitech.com/en-us/products/mice/mx-vertical-ergonomic-mouse.910-005447.html\">Logitech MX Vertical</a>.</p>\n<h2>Time Tracking</h2>\n<p>That white octagon-shaped thing is from <a href=\"https://timeular.com\">Timeular</a>. I use it to track my time for work, which is required since I bill clients.</p>\n<h2>Decoration</h2>\n<p>I spruced it up today by adding some of my books and bobbleheads. </p>\n",

I was writing in Obsidian and posting to Blot, where it would immediately appear on my blog. It was awesome, but I’ll stick with ￼Micro.blog￼ for simplicity.</p>\n<p>I tried <a title=\"Obsidian\" href=\"https://obsidian.md\">Obsidian</a> for all of my writing. I still prefer Ulysses, and I think it’s more about the organization of notes and distractions that become available in Obsidian that sways me back to Ulysses.</p>\n<p>I tried <a title=\"Logseq\" href=\"https://logseq.com\">Logseq</a> for work notes, and it works great for getting things down and creating tasks throughout the day. My biggest grip is that I usually must share notes with my team. Taking light notes in OneNote and immediately updating the documentation for our project works best in the long run. Tasks immediately go into Azure DevOps and are assigned to team members or Microsoft To-Do (accessed through Outlook) for personal work tasks.</p>\n<p>I experimented with a <a title=\"Rocketbook\" href=\"https://getrocketbook.com\">Rocketbook</a> notebook. It didn’t stick. Not a problem with the notebook itself. When I get busy, I struggle to do anything analog, although that seems like it should be the best time to use analog. :( The Rocketbook reminded me of writing on my iPad with the Apple Pencil, which reminded me that I could do that by just taping my iPad Lock Screen and starting to write. I still jot down thoughts this way.</p>\n<p>I also experimented with dropping my RSS feeds altogether. That didn’t go well because I spent more time jumping to various sites to keep up with things. I returned to RSS, tried <a title=\"Inoreader\" href=\"https://www.inoreader.com\">Inoreader</a> for a minute, and thought about returning to <a title=\"Feedbin\" href=\"https://feedbin.com\">Feedbin</a>, but ultimately just added my RSS feeds and newsletters to the Readwise Reader app. Now everything is in one place. Readwise Reader is growing on me, and it is complex but has some great features.</p>\n<p>I played with some AI tools, like <a title=\"ChatGPT\" href=\"https://chat.openai.com/chat\">ChatGPT</a> and <a title=\"Microsoft Bing Chat.\" href=\"https://www.bing.com/new\">Microsoft Bing Chat</a>. I see them as useful search tools for research and troubleshooting.</p>\n<p>I foresee myself testing <a title=\"Microsoft Loop\" href=\"https://loop.microsoft.com/learn\">Microsoft Loop</a>, <a title=\"Microsoft Copilot\" href=\"https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/blog/2023/03/16/introducing-microsoft-365-copilot-a-whole-new-way-to-work/\">Microsoft Copilot</a>, and other miscellaneous tools next.</p>\n",

				"title": "Exploring Microsoft Edge: A Week-Long Experiment",
				"content_html": "<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n",
				"content_text": "<p>This week, I put myself through another experiment and used the Microsoft Edge browser exclusively for work and personal.</p>\n<p>I’ve used Microsoft Edge for work for various reasons and never really had any issues with it. For personal, I was using Safari, but I’ve also experimented with Brave, Firefox, and even Arc.</p>\n<p>With all the recent announcements around the <a href=\"https://www.bing.com/new\">new Bing</a> and other features coming to Microsoft Edge, I thought I would try to use the browser for work and personal for at least a week.</p>\n<p>I’ve been pleasantly surprised! No performance issues or crashes. That is to be expected since I’m already using it for work all day long.</p>\n<p>But there are some features that I started to use that have been surprisingly helpful.</p>\n<h2>Verticle Tabs</h2>\n<p>I don’t leave tabs open, so I don’t have much issue managing them, but the verticle tabs give the browser a clean look that I like.</p>\n<h2>Profiles</h2>\n<p>I’ve been using profiles for work since the feature was released. Profiles allow you to quickly switch to a separate instance of Edge with its logins, sessions, cookies, bookmarks, etc. This is ideal for separating work from personal, but I also have about 15 profiles for various clients, and I can log into their Office 365 environment with a click.</p>\n<h2>The Side Bar</h2>\n<p>When the Side Bar feature was first released, I immediately disabled it and never looked back. However, this week I gave it a try. It is pretty handy for searches and even loading specific sites, and I’ve used it with Feedbin, Micro.blog, and Mastodon. It’s a little glitchy when navigating, but it is convenient for quickly checking email or social updates.</p>\n<p><img style=\"display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\" title=\"Microsoft Edge Screenshot.png\" src=\"https://ericgregorich.micro.blog/uploads/2023/b0f95d942e.png\" alt=\"Microsoft Edge Screenshot\" width=\"772\" height=\"600\" border=\"0\" /></p>\n<h2>Shopping</h2>\n<p>Another feature I had immediately disabled prior but thought I would give a go over the past week is the Shopping integration. Annoying or helpful? If you want to save some money, it can be beneficial. You can even track orders and price changes. Will I continue using it? 🤔 To be decided...</p>\n<h2>Cross-Device</h2>\n<p>Yes, I’ve also been using Microsoft Edge on my phone and tablet, and it’s okay. I prefer Safari for its simplicity, but the Edge mobile apps work great, and having everything synced across devices is excellent.</p>\n<h2>AI Integration</h2>\n<p>It’s too soon to say whether AI integration is helpful, and the features are not released yet. There were <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOeRWRJ16yY&amp;t=1s\">announcements</a> about Bing AI being baked into Microsoft Edge, so you can use it as you browse. Another helpful yet scary feature.</p>\n<p><img style=\"display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\" title=\"Bing AI in Microsoft Edge.png\" src=\"https://ericgregorich.micro.blog/uploads/2023/701a858230.png\" alt=\"Bing AI in Microsoft Edge\" width=\"779\" height=\"452\" border=\"0\" /></p>\n<h2>What I don’t like about Microsoft Edge</h2>\n<p>Of course, there are many things I still don’t like about Microsoft Edge. Microsoft tries to add every feature under the sun to the browser, causing it to be bloated. I know how to turn most things off, so it’s manageable.</p>\n<p>Privacy and Security is also a concern. While edge has many features that make your browsing more secure, you have to accept that Microsoft has at least some telemetry data from you. Who knows for sure what they’re tracking? If that is a concern, look elsewhere.</p>\n<p><img style=\"display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\" title=\"Microsoft Edge Privacy Settings.png\" src=\"https://ericgregorich.micro.blog/uploads/2023/530102d724.png\" alt=\"Microsoft Edge Privacy Settings\" width=\"429\" height=\"600\" border=\"0\" /></p>\n<h2>Will I continue using Microsoft Edge?</h2>\n<p>Yes, until I get bored with it and want to try something else. I’m still trying to grasp all the features available and how they compare to other browsers.</p>\n",

				"content_text": "<p>I had a newsletter a year or so ago where every week, I would gather all of my bookmarks, notes, and resources and turn them into a newsletter where I would share these valuable links with some brief commentary.</p>\n<p>I gave up the newsletter because I often had weekends when I was out of town and was very busy during the week. Taking a couple of hours out to formulate the newsletter was too time-consuming for me.</p>\n<p>Now that I have switched over the Micro.blog, I realize I’m doing the same thing but with a different, more efficient process.</p>\n<p>Rather than pulling it all together once per week, I write content as I discover it throughout the week and post it immediately to my blog. This makes writing much easier because I’m doing it immediately and can write about whatever is on my mind.</p>\n<p>My Micro.blog <a href=\"https://ericgregorich.com/subscribe/\">newsletter</a> then automatically sends every Sunday and contains all of the posts from the previous week.</p>\n<p>I’m essentially writing the same thing, but it’s much easier to post a short update as it comes up rather than waiting and trying to refresh what I was thinking. My new newsletter/blog also feels less formal, with less pressure to write something outstanding every week.</p>\n<p>My last point (for now) is that posting immediately to my blog has eliminated the need for taking notes in many cases. Or perhaps, my blog posts are my notes. 🤔 I no longer need to organize notes for myself if it’s already posted to my site.</p>\n<p>If you like my informal, sometimes blabbering content, where I share resources, interesting content, and random thoughts, you can subscribe to my <a href=\"https://ericgregorich.com/subscribe\">newsletter</a> here.

It’s too cognitively expensive and not rewarding enough. For an old note to be helpful it needs to be presented to Future You in a way that clicks into what you’re working on instantly—with as little processing as possible.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>As you consume content and take generic notes, the AI can transform it into more meaningful text, autocomplete the thought, apply context, and organize it, making it easy to find again.</p>\n<p>As you create content, AI could show your notes as you type. Imagine typing about a topic, and the AI presents the notes to you as you type, as it applies to the current context.</p>\n<p>Many note and reading apps already incorporate AI, including Readwise, Mem, Mymind, Craft, and Notion. Some with plugins that add this, including Obsidian and Logseq. It should quickly evolve to the point envisioned in this essay.</p>\n<p>This essay does not account for the act of writing as a way to help you think and learn. If we let AI do the lifting for us, does that make us smarter, or do we lose the ability to think for ourselves? There is a fine line.</p>\n",

				"content_text": "<p>Have you ever started an email to someone that explains a problem to them, one that you don’t know the solution to, then by the time you finish the email, you’ve realized you have come up with a solution?</p>\n<p>Simply writing out a problem where the explanation is as simple as possible (so someone else can understand it), we are clarifying in our mind precisely what the problem is. You likely don’t understand if you can’t explain the situation to someone else.</p>\n<p>Understanding the problem is only the first part. Now we try to come up with a solution. Often there are multiple solutions. So, we start listing some potential solutions and thinking through the pros and cons of each solution.</p>\n<p>As we write out the potential options to solve the problem, we often eliminate specific options based on what we know about the situation. Perhaps it is a budget issue or an infrastructure limitation. The more we can get down on paper (digital or analog) more likely we are to come up with the best options.</p>\n<p>As a Software Architect, this happens to me all the time. So much that I’ve incorporated this into my workflow. When I need to deal with a problem, even if I think I understand the problem, I write it out in the most straightforward explanation possible. Then each option will have pros and cons, and I’ll usually have a recommendation of which option I think would work best or is most reasonable within the current circumstances.</p>\n<p>After going through this process, I’ve often solved the problem and realized the best solution we can implement immediately. Clients love being told there was a problem and that you already took care of it. There is also the added benefit of having everything documented.</p>\n<p>I’ll write on paper when I’m struggling with something I can’t wrap my head around. This slows me down, so I can spend time thinking as I go. When writing on a computer, it’s easy to spit out words that don’t have as much meaning. On the flip side, a computer makes it easier to delete and reorganize ideas.</p>\n<p>Writing out our problems is not only for technical issues; it can work for anything. This is why Journaling is so beneficial.</p>\n<p>Writing is thinking.</p>\n",

Scheper, 📚 a book about how to create an analog Zettelkasten (slip box) that acts as a “communication partner” for thinking and creating.</p>\n<p><img style=\"display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\" title=\"\" src=\"https://ericgregorich.micro.blog/uploads/2024/a928999a10.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"\" height=\"\" border=\"0\" /></p>\n<p>After seeing a couple of <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCnvMBVMXMPKA4Lmy5Ihd-FQ\">videos</a> from Scott and keeping up with his <a href=\"https://scottscheper.com/\">website</a>, I expected this book to be a deep and dull venture into the analog Zettelkasten, including tons of history and facts. Not that his other content is this way, but the build-up to the book made me think this. However, I thought it flowed nicely and was pretty easy to read. Perhaps this is because I’m already familiar with the material, so I didn’t get stuck at any point. Also, the book appears much longer than it is. Each chapter has several pages of footnotes, and I recommend exploring them, but they take up a lot of space.</p>\n<p><img style=\"display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\" title=\"Antinet Zettelkasten-4.png\" src=\"https://ericgregorich.micro.blog/uploads/2022/8c2e145a24.png\" alt=\"Antinet Zettelkasten 4\" width=\"779\" height=\"438\" border=\"0\" /></p>\n<p>Scott explores the analog Zettelkasten, made famous by <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Niklas_Luhmann\">Niklas Luhmann</a>, a German sociologist, philosopher of social scient, and a prominent thinker in systems theory. Luhmann used a note card system that enabled him to publish dozens of books and hundreds of scholarly articles over his lifetime. The Antinet is Scott’s version of this system, nearly identical to the original.</p>\n<p>The four principles of the Antinet are Analog, Numeric-Alpha, Tree, and Index. The Net in Antinet stands for network. I won’t try to go into the details in this post; there are plenty of other <a href=\"https://zettelkasten.de/posts/introduction-antinet-zettelkasten/\">articles</a> that do this well (or get the <a href=\"https://micro.blog/books/ISBN139798986862613\">book</a>).</p>\n<p>While Scott has an <a href=\"https://scottscheper.com/letter/1/\">article</a> on his website explaining how to get started with an Antinet, the book goes into much more detail. You’ll learn how to create the cards, bib notes, index, and other system components. It does take a while to get to the step-by-step instructions, but it’s probably important to understand the concepts first.</p>\n<p>Scott spends a reasonable amount of time discussing how this analog system can become your “communication partner.” This idea is pulled from Luhmann’s essay “<a href=\"http://luhmann.surge.sh/communicating-with-slip-boxes\">Communicating with Slip Boxes</a>.” If you want to go deeper into Luhmann’s work, you can visit the <a href=\"https://niklas-luhmann-archiv.de/\">Niklas Luhmann Archive</a>.</p>\n<p>Scott mentions (several times) <a href=\"https://www.soenkeahrens.de/en/takesmartnotes\">How to Take Smart Notes</a> by Sönke Ahrens and how, although Sönke introduced the Zettelkasten system to modern day, he also gets much of it wrong, especially by trying to make it work in digital tools.</p>\n<p><img style=\"display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\" title=\"Antinet Zettelkasten-2.png\" src=\"https://ericgregorich.micro.blog/uploads/2022/f15c61122a.png\" alt=\"Antinet Zettelkasten 2\" width=\"779\" height=\"438\" border=\"0\" /></p>\n<p><strong>Who should create an Antinet?</strong> This system is not for those who need to capture technical notes, meeting notes, etc. This is a thinking tool, and you would use it to gather your thoughts during research. The system is best suited for specific projects where you need to do a lot of research, gather your thoughts, and then create an output (academic paper, article, book, etc.).</p>\n<p>You want to use an analog Zettelkasten because it forces you to slow down and think. Not only do you have to take the time to write notes by hand on index cards, but you also have to think about where to put the card. This is intentional, forcing you to think and connect ideas by flipping through your cards. As you do this, you engrain these thoughts into memory.</p>\n<p><strong>Am I going to create my Antinet?</strong> Maybe someday, but I don’t need it now. As I mentioned earlier, it is best to have a big project or do a lot of research. I’ll be honest. When I first read How to Take Smart Notes by Sönke Ahrens, I tried to create a digital Zettelkasten. I spent about a year of my life trying different tools and approaches. I later realized I was pursuing the system for the wrong reasons. I was trying to force a square peg into a round hole. Not only that, I was trying to replicate it in Digital tools, which misses the point.</p>\n<p><img style=\"display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\" title=\"Antinet Zettelkasten.png\" src=\"https://ericgregorich.micro.blog/uploads/2022/ca15ff2154.png\" alt=\"Antinet Zettelkasten\" width=\"779\" height=\"438\" border=\"0\" /></p>\n<p>Overall, this was a good book.

You can also email tasks into your account.</p>\n<p>Otherwise, TuexDuex is a very minimal app, almost like writing on a big sheet of paper.</p>\n<p>One downside of TuexDuex is that it doesn’t work as an actual calendar, so there is no way to plan my work in a calendar view to see what I have time to work on. On the other hand, I don’t need to estimate my tasks and reschedule things all the time. With TeuxDeux, I see the current week and schedule the tasks I plan to work on during the day after reviewing my calendar.

The advantage of doing this in a digital tool is that you can easily link to other notes in your system (if your app supports it).</p>\n<p>The Bullet Journal is a popular analog note-taking, essentially Interstitial Journaling.

It was <a href=\"https://twitter.com/cjgbest/status/1602370307884318720\">quickly corrected</a> by Substack Co-founder/CEO Chris Best.</p>\n<p>Substack is not “powered” by Ghost. Instead, a specific site using Substack was built using Substacks theming API, which is compatible with themes built for Ghost. This means the developer who implemented the Substack theme basically ported the Ghost theme for Substack. All of this was done legally using best practices (according to Chris Best).</p>\n<p>What I find funny is all of the responses to the original post, even those posted after the corrections were stated in the same thread. People are congratulating Ghost and have completely made the assumption that <a href=\"https://substack.com\">Substack</a> is now Powered by <a href=\"https://ghost.org/\">Ghost</a>, which is not true at all.</p>\n<p>If you see such a claim by an individual on Twitter, of all places, do you not question its legitimacy?

				"content_text": "<p>This interesting essay explores the “Ghost in the Box” metaphor and how it applies to a Zettelkasten. The main idea (as I understand it) is that when you build a complex system of notes, they appear unfinished and confusing when others view them, but to you, they’re useful and full of insight. It is the time and effort that makes the system useful and increases your understanding. When you move your Zettelkasten from one tool to another or analog to digital, you’re potentially replacing the core piece of what made it special.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>We are now entering the paradox of the Ship of Theseus. Imagine a ship leaving the harbour with a certain set of parts. During the journey, parts break down and are replaced by new ones. When the ship returns home, all parts are replaced by new ones. Is the ship still the same?

				"title": "UpNote - A beautiful, cross-platform app for notes",
				"content_html": "<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n",
				"content_text": "<p>When it comes to my note-taking app, I have a few criteria.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Can I write in it? I’m talking about simple, distraction-free writing. Markdown support is necessary to write and add some basic formatting without leaving the keyboard.</li>\n<li>Can I get my notes out of it? I don’t want to use any application where I’ll struggle to move my notes elsewhere.</li>\n<li>Is it available everywhere? As a user of Windows, Mac, and iOS, I need an app that will work everywhere.</li>\n<li>Is it flexible? Can I organize my notes by folders or tags? I don’t organize much and rely on search to find what I need. Some simple tags and a couple of folders suit my workflow.</li>\n<li>Can I easily publish my notes elsewhere? Sometimes it’s my blog. Sometimes it is to a PDF or some other application.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>If I were only using a Mac, I’d probably use Bear for my notes. I love its clean and simple interface, speed, and export capabilities. But I’m also using Windows, so I’ve been searching for an app that will meet my requirements.</p>\n<p>I have been using Evernote for years, and it checks some of the boxes. The biggest downside to Evernote is the note editor is not as clean as I would like, and getting notes out of Evernote can be a pain Although many apps import from Evernote, it’s not a great experience.</p>\n<p>Then I discovered <a title=\"UpNote\" href=\"https://getupnote.com\">UpNote</a>, a notes app similar to Bear. UpNote supports markdown and has a focus mode, making it a pleasure to write in. The sync is fast and reliable. It has plenty of features. I can organize by folder and tags. And it’s available on macOS, Windows, iOS, Android, and even Linux. I can export to various formats, including Markdown or PDF.</p>\n<p>What is UpNote missing? Well, on paper, it’s not missing much. In reality, a few things would make it perfect (for me). One is the ability to drag and drop notes into folders. Not a big deal. Since folders can be organized in any order, you can create sub-folders and even add colors and images to folder thumbnails, I’ll let it slide. Maybe some more explore options and better Markdown export. When I copy Markdown into other apps, sometimes I have to fix some things.</p>\n<p>There is also something else that is missing that I can’t quite put my finger on. You may get some level of polish from apps like Bear or Ulysses. UpNote is a beautiful app, but if I were to compare the UI, Bear might be a 9 or 10, while UpNote is an 8 or 9. UpNote’s UI is beautiful but safe and not as exciting to use as other premium apps.</p>\n<p>I will stick with UpNote for a while and see if it meets my needs long-term. Let me know if you use the app yourself or know of any similar apps!</p>\n",

				"content_html": "<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n",
				"content_text": "<p>Evernote <a title=\"announced\" href=\"https://evernote.com/blog/evernote-next-move-joining-bending-spoons/\">announced</a> Bending Spoons, a developer of mobile apps had acquired them. Bending Spoons is known for (or not known for) its mobile apps, including, Splice, Remini, and 30 Day Fitness.</p>\n<p>Like many, my first thoughts were, “this doesn’t make sense. Evernote is doomed!”. However, Bending Spoons must have the funds and technology to take Evernote to the next level. In a way, this is kind of exciting. Let’s hope they don’t blow it.</p>\n<p>What does this purchase mean for Evernote? It’s hard to say without knowing more about Bending Spoons. Looking through their website, it appears they’re heavily invested in AI (who isn’t these days). Adding some AI to Evernote could be pretty exciting. Evernote is already great (if not the best) at capturing and storing information. Adding AI to help connect notes, write text, update media, etc., could be a welcome addition. It’s also possible Bending Spoons does absolutely nothing with Evernote, and it’s business as usual.</p>\n<p>I’ve been an Evernote user for over a decade and have accumulated nearly 7 thousand notes. Like many, Evernote has become a dumping ground where everything gets added to a massive black hole, never to be seen again. Don’t get me wrong, Evernote search is excellent, and with OCR, notebooks, and tags, users who like to use Evernote for their daily workflow have many options.</p>\n<p>I keep jumping into the Evernote app to see what’s new and occasionally to grab an old note. I just haven’t been able to stick with it lately because of the bloat. There are many other simple and sleeker tools out there today.</p>\n<p>I must admit that Evernote has come a long way in the past year or two after its massive rewrite. The app is pretty fast and responsive on all platforms. If it had better export and the ability to hide the features I don’t want to use, it would be tempting to use it full-time again. At this point, I’ll wait to see how this acquisition turns out before jumping back in.</p>\n",

				"content_html": "<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n",
				"content_text": "<p>I use a feed reader to pull in all the articles I’m interested in (using RSS), YouTube channels I subscribe to, social network lists, and even email newsletters. This allows me to avoid endless feeds, algorithms, and unwanted ads. When I read something, it is marked as read, and I don’t need to see it again.</p>\n<p>I’ve tried several feed readers over the years since Google Reader was killed. The list includes Feedly, Inoreader, NetNewsWire, News Explorer, Reader, and others. Some of them have great features that I like. I especially liked the ability to take highlights and notes in Feedly pro, and they would sync automatically into my Readwise account.</p>\n<p>However, the feed reader I’ve stuck with the longest is <a title=\"Feedbin\" href=\"http://feedbin.com\">Feedbin</a>. Why? I think there are a few reasons.</p>\n<h2 id=\"1feedbinissimple\">1) Feedbin is Simple</h2>\n<p>Feedbin doesn’t try to do too much. It has a simple and clean UI. You can use other Feed Readers with Feedbin, like <a title=\"Reeder\" href=\"https://reederapp.com\">Reeder</a>, <a title=\"Unread\" href=\"https://www.goldenhillsoftware.com/unread/\">Unread</a>, and many <a href=\"https://feedbin.com/apps\">others</a>. I find the Feedbin iOS apps are great and get the job done.</p>\n<h2 id=\"2feedbinsupportsnewsletters\">2) Feedbin supports newsletters</h2>\n<p>As I said, I now send all of my newsletters directly to Feedbin. This helps keep my email clean. I like the way Feedbin handles email newsletters. Rather than parsing the text, like it would most web articles, it gives me the option to show the newsletter in its original format, which I find better.</p>\n<p>Here is an example newsletter from <a title=\"NessLabs\" href=\"https://nesslabs.com\">Ness Labs</a>.</p>\n<figure><img src=\"uploads/2022/9d094e3c73.png\" alt=\"Example Ness Labs newsletter shown in Feedbin\" />\n<figcaption>Example Ness Labs newsletter shown in Feedbin</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<h2 id=\"3feedbinhandlestweetsandmicro.blogpostswell\">3) Feedbin handles Tweets and Micro.blog posts well</h2>\n<p>Feedbin lets you subscribe to Twitter users and lists, which is excellent in itself, but I love that I can click the little chat icon and see the entire thread directly in Feedbin.</p>\n<figure><img src=\"uploads/2022/c48a1967bc.png\" alt=\"Example Tweet Thread in Feedbin\" />\n<figcaption>Example Tweet Thread in Feedbin</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<p>This also works with Micro.blog. If you add the <a title=\"Discover Feed\" href=\"https://micro.blog/discover\">Discover feed</a> or follow individual users, you click on the small Micro.blog icon to see the entire thread without leaving Feedbin.</p>\n<p>You still need to leave Feedbin and open the original post to reply. :(</p>\n<h2 id=\"4feedbinletsmesharedirectlytomicro.blogandothers\">4) Feedbin lets me share directly to Micro.blog and others</h2>\n<p>If I see something interesting while reading in Feedbin, I can easily share using the native Share Sheet or even share the link and my comments directly to my blog.</p>\n<figure><img src=\"uploads/2022/dc9a2b475a.png\" alt=\"Example share with Micro.blog from Feedbin\" />\n<figcaption>Example share with Micro.blog from Feedbin</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<p><a title=\"Feedbin\" href=\"http://feedbin.com\">Feedbin</a> is not perfect.

Instead, it is about how this “Attention Crisis” impacts society.</p>\n<p>Here are some of my notes about the author’s points in this book.</p>\n<h2 id=\"whatimpactisthisattentioncrisishavingonourlives\">What impact is this Attention Crisis having on our lives?</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>We’re finding it harder to find “Flow,” during which we become engrossed in an activity without disruptions.</li>\n<li>With all the tiny bits of information continuously flowing into our lives, it becomes less likely that we’ll read books.</li>\n<li>It’s harder to think because we don’t allow our minds to wonder as much as we should. Mind wandering is a critical stage in which our brain has insights, makes connections, and plans for the future.</li>\n<li>Technology is becoming better at keeping us distracted. The more we look at their service, the more money the company makes, so they manipulate us to keep us engaged.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"whatiscontributingtothisattentioncrisis\">What is contributing to this Attention Crisis?</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>We’re bombarded with chemicals that harm our health and, ultimately, our attention.</li>\n<li>Failing to explore ADHD. More people than ever are diagnosed with ADHD, yet we’ve prescribed medications rather than solving the causes.</li>\n<li>Our children are not allowed to explore and play like in the past. They’re no longer playing in the streets and wandering the neighborhood. They’re told precisely what to do in school and what the outcome should be rather than allowing creative learning.</li>\n<li>We’re not getting enough sleep due to artificial light and consumer capitalism. We’re spending too much time flipping through Tick-Tock videos rather than going to bed at a decent time and allowing our brains to recover and make connections during sleep.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"howdowerecover\">How do we recover?</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Fewer work hours to allow us more time to rest and recover.</li>\n<li>Allow our children more time to play and explore, especially at school.</li>\n<li>Change our technology to be less disruptive to our lives. Yet, the companies building it do not have an incentive to do so unless regulations are established, which is an entirely different issue.</li>\n<li>Take it upon ourselves to control what we consume, get more sleep and exercise, and spend quality time reading and just being bored. It’s good for us!</li>\n</ul>\n<p><a title=\"Stolen Focus\" href=\"https://amzn.to/3Uaacpe\">Get Stolen Focus on Amazon</a>.</p>\n",

Yet, the author explains, it’s part of how we learn and create.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>“Creativity is not where you create some new thing that’s emerged from your brain.” “It’s a new association between two things already there.” Mind-wandering allows “more extended trains of thought to unfold, which allows for more associations to be made.” - Stolen Focus p96</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>While this is nothing new, it caught my attention because I daydream. Ever since I was a kid, I would get in trouble for not paying attention. I suppose my excuse now is, “I’m creating something!”.</p>\n<p>Mind wandering is a necessary part of how our brains work. For example, as we read, we focus on the words. Our mind tries to make connections to the ideas we’re reading about. We may think of past experiences, related reading, or even contradictions. This is precisely what we should be doing. This part of reading helps us learn and make sense of things.</p>\n<p>Of course, we can easily take our minds wandering too far when we’re trying to read but keep thinking about checking Twitter or what’s for dinner. In these cases, we’re getting into distraction territory.</p>\n",

This makes sense since it’s all RSS.</p>\n<p>What I like about Airshow is its simplicity. It’s a beautiful app. There are no bells and whistles. You can add podcasts as a Subscription or Bookmark. Subscriptions are automatically downloaded and added to your queue. Bookmarks give you quick access to podcasts you are interested in but don’t listen to regularly.</p>\n<p>Your queue is a simple list of podcast episodes. You can reorder them and edit them as you like. The queue is synced to your Feedbin account so you can also view the podcasts from Feedbin.</p>\n<figure><img src=\"uploads/2022/1087891f01.jpg\" alt=\"The Airshow Play Screen\" />\n<figcaption>The Airshow Play Screen</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<figure><img src=\"uploads/2022/75e3d69bca.jpg\" alt=\"Airshow Subscription Screen\" />\n<figcaption>Airshow Subscription Screen</figcaption>\n</figure>\n",

				"title": "The true purpose of a Zettelkasten",
				"content_html": "<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n",
				"content_text": "<p>A Zettelkasten is a German word that translates to “slip box.” The term became used to describe a particular workflow that Niklas Luhmann used to publish about 50 books and 550 articles over his career.</p>\n<p>Many great articles are out there describing Niklas Luhmann’s Zettelkasten system. As well as a few books, so I won’t go into those details here. Instead, I want to focus on the key concepts I realized about a Zettelkasten over time.</p>\n<p>A Zettelkasten is a box of notes. Luhmann’s workflow to take and organize notes became synonymous with Zettelkasten. When we hear the word Zettelkasten today, we think of the workflow process, not necessarily a box of index cards.</p>\n<p>Sönke Ahrens helped make the Zettelkasten popular with his book How To Take Smart Notes. Sönke introduced the names of the various types of notes, Fleeting, Literature, Permanent, and Project, to describe the various phases of Luhmann’s workflow. However, these names were never part of Luhmann’s vocabulary to describe his system (in fact, Luhmann rarely talked about his workflow).</p>\n<p>Digital tools try to mimic the Zettelkasten workflow that Luhmann used. However, digital tools have many advantages that make some parts of his analog workflow seem wasteful, such as numbering and limiting space to what fits on a 4x6 card. We can now easily connect notes using Wiki Links, see connections using Backlinks, see a graph of notes related to the current note, and even see a visual of the entire system to identify clusters of information. Not to mention full-text search and hyperlinks!</p>\n<p>While we can take advantage of these digital tools, we need to remember the fundamental purpose of the Zettelkasten. It’s not to make as many notes and connections as we can to grow an enormous graph that will somehow start answering all of our questions and do the writing for us.</p>\n<div class=\"kg-card kg-callout-card kg-callout-card-blue\">\n<div class=\"kg-callout-text\">Luhmann’s Zettelkasten system worked because it forced him to slow down and think about each idea and how it relates to the other ideas. Numbering each card to connect it to another card was a painstaking process, which required him to spend more time organizing his notes than actually writing his publications. This gave him the time (in his head) to make real connections and insights. Digital tools can easily abstract this from us if we’re not careful.</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"kg-card kg-callout-card kg-callout-card-green\">\n<div class=\"kg-callout-text\">Another reason Luhmann created so much content is that throughout his process, he spent time creating output that would be used in his work. Rather than capturing and making quick notes, he spent the time writing out his interpretation in his own words. When writing his publications, his thinking was already done, and he could focus on creating a draft.</div>\n</div>\n<h2 id=\"quotes\">Quotes</h2>\n<blockquote>\n<p>“Of course, I do not think of all this on my own; it mostly happens in my file. … In essence, the filing system explains my productivity. … Filing takes more of my time than writing the books” - Niklas Luhmann</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>“What Luhmann appeared to have done instead was to immediately write his own thoughts on whatever he read in a way that would be as close to being publishable as possible. That’s what allowed him to be so productive, he was constantly creating output, rather than accumulating knowledge in a way that may lead to future output, which is what most of us do when taking notes.” (level 1, Zettelkasten is NOT a note-taking system(?))</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>“Write all your notes and quotes on separate three-by-five-inch cards. Then, when you get ready to organize your thinking, just spread them all out on the floor, see the natural structure that emerges, and figure out what’s missing.” (David Allen, Getting Things Done)</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h2 id=\"additional-reading\">Additional Reading</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"http://luhmann.surge.sh/communicating-with-slip-boxes\">Communicating with Slip Boxes by Niklas Luhmann</a> - An article by Niklas Luhmann explains how his file system became a communication partner.</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/88f8/fa9dfbc0c2b296758dd932b871917c5c775a.pdf?_ga=2.255211660.501069040.1661645834-1988662615.1661645834\">Niklas Luhmann’s Card Index by Johannes Schmidt</a> - A chapter describing Niklas Luhmann’s card index in detail.</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://amzn.to/3dRuuDW\">How to Take Smart Notes by Sönke Ahrens</a> - The book that popularized the Zettelkasten system.</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://scottscheper.com/letter/1/\">How to Get Started Building and Antinet Zettelkasten</a> - If you’re interested in an analog Zettelkasten, Scott Scheper may describe it best.

				"content_text": "<p><a href=\"https://raindrop.io\">Raindrop.io</a> has become one of those apps that I use nearly every day. With so much content on the web, we need a place to save what we find helpful. Raindrop does just that. It is a bookmarking service that works on nearly any device and browser.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Save and recall interesting content.</li>\n<li>Save articles and videos to read or watch later.</li>\n<li>Read articles and make highlights and annotations. <a href=\"https://readwise.io/raindrop_syncing\">Sync highlights</a> with <a href=\"https://readwise.io/\">Readwise</a>.</li>\n<li>Save inspirational images.</li>\n<li>Share bookmarks with others.</li>\n<li>Create an RSS feed of a collection that can be shared and consumed in other applications.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"platforms\">Platforms</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Browser Extension for Chrome, Edge, Safari, Firefox, and Brave.</li>\n<li>Mobile app for iPhone, iPad, and Android.</li>\n<li>Desktop app for macOS, Windows, and Linux.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"organization\">Organization</h2>\n<p>Raindrop allows you to create Collections (Folders) and Tags. With the Pro version, you can create nested collections. You can also create Groups to help organize your collections.</p>\n<p>I have been using the <a href=\"https://fortelabs.co/blog/para/\">PARA</a> method to provide a straightforward way to organize content. I like to keep it simple.</p>\n<figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img class=\"kg-image\" src=\"https://ericgregorich.micro.blog/uploads/2022/9e177e74a6.jpg\" alt=\"\" /></figure>\n<ul>\n<li>Unsorted: Things I want to read or watch later. They’ll often be deleted unless they’re worth keeping, then I’ll send them to another collection and add some tags.</li>\n<li>Shared: I have a shared collection of Microsoft and <a href=\"https://raindrop.io/egregorich/focustivity-resources-26717462/search\">Focustivity bookmarks</a>.</li>\n<li>Projects: I create a collection for each project where I gather links and web content. I don’t usually have many projects of this type.</li>\n<li>Areas: A collection for each area of my life. I’ll store manuals, links to important sites, and other things here.</li>\n<li>Resources: This is where most of my bookmarks go. I have a single Resources collection that I dump everything into. I add a couple of tags to make it easier to filter later.</li>\n<li>Archive: Where I keep archived projects.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"highlights\">Highlights</h2>\n<p>One of my favorite features in Raindrop is the Highlights. Once installed with the browser extension, you can highlight text on a page and save the highlight directly to Raindrop. You can also use this feature now in Raindrop (like the image below). Select a webpage, highlight some text, and add annotations if you want.</p>\n<figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img class=\"kg-image\" src=\"https://ericgregorich.micro.blog/uploads/2022/2295115915.jpg\" alt=\"\" /></figure>\n<p>These highlights can <a href=\"https://readwise.io/raindrop_syncing\">sync to Readwise</a> (this feature was not announced at the time of this post).</p>\n<h2 id=\"search\">Search</h2>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://help.raindrop.io/using-search/\">search</a> functionality is pretty solid, featuring Full-Text search meaning it will find content within your bookmarks and PDFs. You can use the filters to quickly select a tag, date, type, or other criteria.</p>\n<figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img class=\"kg-image\" src=\"https://ericgregorich.micro.blog/uploads/2022/13201232e0.jpg\" alt=\"\" /></figure>\n<h2 id=\"pricing\">Pricing</h2>\n<p>The pricing of Raindrop is reasonable. I think most people can get by with the free version, which includes unlimited bookmarks, collections, highlights, and most features.</p>\n<p>The pro version provides extra features like full-text search, nested collections, annotations, duplicate link finder, automatic backups, 10Gb files per month, and priority email support.</p>\n<h2 id=\"who-is-raindrop-for\">Who is Raindrop for?</h2>\n<p>Raindrop is not going to be a replacement for an academic research tool like Zotero, where you will need citations, PDF annotations, and integrations to note applications like Obsidian.</p>\n<p>For anyone who wants to save bookmarks, and does some light highlighting and annotations, then Raindrop is a great option.</p>\n",

All the app does is give you seven screens to write text.</p>\n<p>Are you blown away yet?</p>\n<p>Yeah, it sounds pretty simple. Then when you mention the $19.99 price tag, you will laugh.</p>\n<p>What this app does is extremely simple, yet it fits a need that I’ve been looking for. I wanted a standalone app that gives me a page of text I can write on throughout the day. I keep notes, tasks, links, clipboard text, and all kinds of things on this page. This page syncs across devices, including my phone, so I can quickly update it throughout the day.</p>\n<p>Using a “Working Memory” text file on your computer is nothing new. In his podcast, Cal Newport talks about it and has an <a href=\"https://www.calnewport.com/blog/2015/10/27/deep-habits-workingmemory-txt-the-most-important-productivity-tool-youve-never-heard-of/\">article</a> explaining his method.</p>\n<p>When using only Microsoft Windows, I would use Notepad all the time for this. Now that I’m on Mac, I tried using an Apple Note or a simple document that syncs across devices. I think the biggest problem I had with them is there were too many options. I did more formatting and playing around with the note than just using it.</p>\n<p>I only just started using Tot Pocket. So far, I like it. The sync is fast and reliable and has just enough features to allow me to jot down notes and tasks throughout the day without being distracted.</p>\n",

				"content_text": "<p>I recently switched my setup to a Mac. As a long-time Windows user, this is quite a jarring transition. There were some things I immediately missed from Windows and some things that I had to spend some time figuring out because they make no sense on a Mac.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Poor window management.</li>\n<li>Closing an app doesn’t quit it.</li>\n<li>Every app seems to have a menu icon that clutters the top menu.</li>\n<li>Lacking alt-tab to switch windows.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>I will share some critical apps and tips I learned while setting up my Mac mini to be a lean, productive machine.</p>\n<h2 id=\"keyboard-shortcuts\">Keyboard Shortcuts</h2>\n<p>Since I’m already moving to a Mac, I may as well get better at using keyboard shortcuts and use the mouse less.</p>\n<p>Learning keyboard shortcuts is one of the best things you can do for productivity. It takes so much time to reach for the mouse and move it to click on something.</p>\n<p>Keyboard shortcuts allow you quickly search and execute tasks without removing your fingers from the keyboard.</p>\n<p>Learning these keyboard shortcuts can be daunting, and I still struggle with them, especially with various applications using different shortcuts for different purposes.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Keep the <a href=\"https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201236\" rel=\"noopener ugc nofollow\">Mac keyboard shortcuts — Apple Support</a> documentation handy.</li>\n<li>Look for the Keyboard Shortcuts for your favorite apps.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"some-critical-keyboard-shortcuts-on-mac\">Some critical keyboard shortcuts on Mac</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>CTRL-CMD-Q: Lock the desktop.</li>\n<li>SHIFT-CMD-Q: Log out.</li>\n<li>CMD-SPACE: To search for anything.</li>\n<li>CMD-X: Cut the selected item to the clipboard.</li>\n<li>CMD-C: Copy the selected item to the clipboard.</li>\n<li>CMD-V: Paste the selected item from the clipboard.</li>\n<li>CMD-W: Close the current window</li>\n<li>CMD-Q: Quit the existing app</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"essential-utilities\">Essential Utilities</h2>\n<p>Several utilities help make the Mac faster and easier to get things done. Here are a few that I’ve discovered so far.</p>\n<h3 id=\"setapp\">SetApp</h3>\n<p><a href=\"https://go.setapp.com/invite/bl2jnwf8\" rel=\"noopener ugc nofollow\">Setapp</a> is a service that consolidates hundreds of Mac and iOS apps into one subscription. Setapp can save you a ton of money, depending on your apps, and it’s worth checking SetApp before purchasing any apps on the Mac. Like I did, you may find it cheaper to get a SetApp subscription that includes the apps you want and hundreds of other apps and utilities.</p>\n<h3 id=\"raycast\">Raycast</h3>\n<p>Mac OS has a built-in Spotlight search that triggers when you click CMD-Space. If you find Spotlight lacking, check out <a href=\"https://www.raycast.com/\" rel=\"noopener ugc nofollow\">Raycast</a>.</p>\n<p>Raycast is a fast and extendable application launcher that does so much more. You can search anything, open anything, manage windows, and perform various other tasks that I have yet to explore.</p>\n<p>Be sure to take the time to go through the provided walk-through. Once you realize the power of Raycast, the sky is the limit.</p>\n<p>Alternatives include Alfred.</p>\n<h3 id=\"1password\">1Password</h3>\n<p>When setting up any OS, I first install 1Password, where all my passwords and other information are securely stored.</p>\n<p>You could get by with Apple’s Keychain if you only use the Apple ecosystem. Other alternatives include LastPass and Dashlane.</p>\n<h3 id=\"bartender\">Bartender</h3>\n<p>Nearly every app you install on your Mac creates a menu icon in the top-right that gives you quick access to some of the functionality. Eventually, you’ll end up with a menu bar that spans the width of your monitor, which is distracting.</p>\n<p>Bartender allows you to configure this menu, only showing the icons you want to see and hiding the rest under a menu.</p>\n<h3 id=\"cleanmymac-x\">CleanMyMac X</h3>\n<p>I’m constantly installing and uninstalling applications, testing to see what they do and if they help me. Unfortunately, this leaves clutter on the MAC, including files and folders and other settings that get left behind even when you uninstall.</p>\n<p>CleanMyMac helps remove all of this unnecessary clutter from your Mac.</p>\n<h3 id=\"bettersnaptool\">BetterSnapTool</h3>\n<p>I have a widescreen monitor, and the biggest thing I missed from Windows is the ability to snap my windows to various positions on the screen.</p>\n<p>BetterSnapTool does this on the Mac. You can easily position your apps and create custom areas for them to snap. Very handy!</p>\n<p>Some alternatives are Mosaic and Magnet. I’ve begun using Raycast to manage my windows using keyboard shortcuts, which I’m enjoying.</p>\n<h3 id=\"cleanshot-x\">CleanShot X</h3>\n<p>CleanShot X provides some excellent screen-capture capabilities. Quickly take screenshots, annotate them, then share them.</p>\n<h2 id=\"great-apps-exclusive-to-the-apple-ecosystem\">Great apps, exclusive to the Apple Ecosystem</h2>\n<p>One of the biggest reasons I switched to a Mac for my setup is the great apps. It feels like apps on Windows are an afterthought and are usually only ported web applications anyway.</p>\n<h3 id=\"things-3\">Things 3</h3>\n<p>Things 3 is probably one of the most elegant task management applications.</p>\n<h3 id=\"bear\">Bear</h3>\n<p>My favorite writing and note-taking application, Bear, is a straightforward markdown-based app that lets you focus on writing. You can organize your notes using tags.</p>\n<h3 id=\"craft\">Craft</h3>\n<p>Craft may arguably be the best all-purpose note-taking and documentation creation app. It is simple to use and has a beautiful design, and I use it to organize my life.</p>\n<h3 id=\"fantastical\">Fantastical</h3>\n<p>Fantastical is an excellent calendar app that goes beyond the out-of-the-box Apple calendar. Its most prominent feature may be the autocomplete functionality, and you can type an event or task in natural language, which will set all the details for you!</p>\n<p>I’ve only been using the Mac for a few weeks. I hope what I shared is useful. What are your favorite apps and tricks for the Mac? I’d love to learn more.</p>\n",

Your mind and body and simple and don’t need extravagance.</li>\n<li>Nature will always change to do what is best for nature. You are part of nature. Trust the change.</li>\n<li>You have limited time in this world. Don’t spend it procrastinating on things of importance.</li>\n<li>Focus on things as if it was the last thing you will do in life.</li>\n<li>You have one life, and it’s almost over.</li>\n<li>Take the time to learn things for yourself and less for others.</li>\n<li>Listen to your heart, and find your happiness.</li>\n<li>No one can prevent you from being in harmony with nature.</li>\n<li>Sinning out of desire is worse than doing so out of anger.

You can’t control nature, perception, the nature of the body, the soul.</li>\n</ol>\n",
