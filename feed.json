				"title": "Why Micro.blog is a great Twitter alternative",
				"content_html": "<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n",
				"content_text": "<p>Micro.blog gives you a central hub to post and share content while connecting with other microbloggers and wider indie web community members. With your blog, you can instantly share short status updates, long-form writing, and photos. By using <a href=\"https://indieweb.org/principles\">IndieWeb</a> standards on your domain, you can keep control over your data and start generating an online identity that is uniquely yours.</p>\n<p>When I first discovered <a href=\"http://micro.blog/\">Micro.blog</a> a couple of years ago, I didn’t think much of it and thought it was another basic blogging platform. However, after another look a couple of months ago, I thought I would give it a go. Now, I’m hooked, and I’m starting to understand the significance of the platform. </p>\n<h2 id=\"whatismicro.blog\">What is Micro.blog?</h2>\n<p>On the surface, Micro.blog’s core feature is as a blogging platform. You can post using standard Markdown, and your posts immediately appear on your blog. You can edit the post, change your themes, and even use plugins and themes built by the community to customize your blog. This is all great, but there is much more to it.</p>\n<p>When you post to Micro.blog, your post is also sent to the Micro.blog timeline. You will see the blog posts created by other Micro.blog users you follow when you visit the timeline. Others will also see your posts in their timeline when they follow you.</p>\n<p>It sounds like Twitter, right? Exactly! But there are some important limitations of Micro.blog. </p>\n<ul>\n<li>Micro.blog does not support Likes.</li>\n<li>You cannot “retweet” content.</li>\n<li>There are no algorithms.</li>\n<li>You can’t see who is following you.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>These limitations are intentional.</strong> The founder of Micro.blog, <a href=\"https://www.manton.org/\">Manton Reece</a>, will not add these distracting features to Micro.blog. Trust me; this is what makes Micro.blog special. Rather than seeking “fake” engagement, Micro.blog encourages conversations. You don’t click a “like” icon if you like a post; instead, you respond and say why you liked the post. </p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>It turns out that there is more to conversations than a number of “likes” or “retweets.” I find the discussions on Micro.blog to be more engaging and thoughtful than those on Twitter.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>You can also “<strong>cross-post</strong>” from Micro.blog to other platforms, including Twitter, Mastodon, LinkedIn, and Medium. This means you can write on Micro.blog and your content automatically goes to the other platforms (if you choose), making your blog the “hub” for everything you write.</p>\n<figure><img src=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/81720/2022/7c8e44a734.png\" alt=\"Micro.blog Input and Output\" />\n<figcaption>Micro.blog Input and Output</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<p>Another feature of Micro.blog is that it is designed for short posts (under 280 characters) and long-form blog posts. These short posts are what you would post to Twitter, but instead, you’re posting them to your blog (and automatically cross-post it to Twitter if you want). The long posts are also included, but instead of the full post content, you’ll get a link to the blog post in the timeline.</p>\n<h2 id=\"youareincontrol.\">You are in control.</h2>\n<p>Let’s say you are (or were) a Twitter user. You tweet interesting things to your timeline on Twitter. If you say something Twitter doesn’t like, you get banned from the platform, and all your content is blocked. Micro.blog lets you keep control over your content. You own your domain and blog, so nothing can happen to it. You can even move it to another platform if you choose. </p>\n<p>In addition, by putting all your content on your blog, you get long-term benefits from search engines. You get credit for your content, not some big company.</p>\n<h2 id=\"thecommunityisoutstanding.\">The community is outstanding.</h2>\n<p>Another reason I love Micro.blog is the community. People of all ages, interests, and backgrounds are coming together to share blogs, stories, and knowledge. The community is full of people here to help and support each other, and it shows in the comments and interactions on the platform every day.</p>\n<p>Because you can’t see who follows you or who “likes” your content, there may be an adjustment period. It will take some time to meet people with similar interests, and I recommend using the <a href=\"https://micro.blog/discover\">Discover feed</a>. Also, when you find someone interested, look to see who they follow. </p>\n<h2 id=\"morecoolfeaturesofmicro.blog.\">More cool features of Micro.blog.</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Community themes and plugins. You can also build your own!</li>\n<li>Premium users get Podcast hosting and Newsletters.</li>\n<li>The Bookshelves feature lets you track and quickly post about your favorite books.</li>\n<li>Post from multiple apps (Ulysses, MarsEdit, iA Writer, Obsidian, etc.)</li>\n<li>The founder, Manton, and the rest of the Micro.blog team is fully engaged, active in the community, and quick to respond if you need help. </li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"conclusion\">Conclusion</h2>\n<p>I sincerely hope that you give Micro.blog a try. There is no doubt that it is an excellent alternative to Twitter. If you are looking to grow an audience, it may not be for you, but if you want to find like minded people and take control over your content, you should give it a shot.</p>\n<h2 id=\"somemicro.blogresources\">Some Micro.blog Resources</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://micro.blog/'\">Micro.blog</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://help.micro.blog/t/community-guidelines/39\">Community Guidelines</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://help.micro.blog/t/help-documents-table-of-contents/311\">Micro.blog Help Center</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://gohugo.io/documentation/\">Hugo Documentation</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"additionalreading\">Additional Reading</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.hanselman.com/blog/your-words-are-wasted\">Your words are wasted</a> - Scott Hanselman</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://indieweb.org/principles\">IndieWeb Principles</a></li>\n<li><a title=\"ActivityPub Documentation\" href=\"https://www.w3.org/TR/activitypub/\">ActivityPub Documentation</a></li>\n</ul>\n",

				"title": "UpNote - A beautiful, cross-platform app for notes",
				"content_html": "<p>When it comes to my note-taking app, I have a few criteria.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Can I write in it? I’m talking about simple, distraction-free writing. Markdown support is necessary to write and add some basic formatting without leaving the keyboard.</li>\n<li>Can I get my notes out of it? I don’t want to use any application where I’ll struggle to move my notes elsewhere.</li>\n<li>Is it available everywhere? As a user of Windows, Mac, and iOS, I need an app that will work everywhere.</li>\n<li>Is it flexible? Can I organize my notes by folders or tags? I don’t organize much and rely on search to find what I need. Some simple tags and a couple of folders suit my workflow.</li>\n<li>Can I easily publish my notes elsewhere? Sometimes it’s my blog. Sometimes it is to a PDF or some other application.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>If I were only using a Mac, I’d probably use Bear for my notes. I love its clean and simple interface, speed, and export capabilities. But I’m also using Windows, so I’ve been searching for an app that will meet my requirements.</p>\n<p>I have been using Evernote for years, and it checks some of the boxes. The biggest downside to Evernote is the note editor is not as clean as I would like, and getting notes out of Evernote can be a pain Although many apps import from Evernote, it’s not a great experience.</p>\n<p>Then I discovered <a href=\"https://getupnote.com\" title=\"UpNote\">UpNote</a>, a notes app similar to Bear. UpNote supports markdown and has a focus mode, making it a pleasure to write in. The sync is fast and reliable. It has plenty of features. I can organize by folder and tags. And it’s available on macOS, Windows, iOS, Android, and even Linux. I can export to various formats, including Markdown or PDF.</p>\n<p>What is UpNote missing? Well, on paper, it’s not missing much. In reality, a few things would make it perfect (for me). One is the ability to drag and drop notes into folders. Not a big deal. Since folders can be organized in any order, you can create sub-folders and even add colors and images to folder thumbnails, I’ll let it slide.

				"content_text": "When it comes to my note-taking app, I have a few criteria. \n\n- Can I write in it? I’m talking about simple, distraction-free writing. Markdown support is necessary to write and add some basic formatting without leaving the keyboard.\n- Can I get my notes out of it? I don’t want to use any application where I’ll struggle to move my notes elsewhere.\n- Is it available everywhere? As a user of Windows, Mac, and iOS, I need an app that will work everywhere.\n- Is it flexible? Can I organize my notes by folders or tags? I don’t organize much and rely on search to find what I need. Some simple tags and a couple of folders suit my workflow.\n- Can I easily publish my notes elsewhere? Sometimes it’s my blog. Sometimes it is to a PDF or some other application.\n\nIf I were only using a Mac, I’d probably use Bear for my notes. I love its clean and simple interface, speed, and export capabilities. But I’m also using Windows, so I’ve been searching for an app that will meet my requirements. \n\nI have been using Evernote for years, and it checks some of the boxes. The biggest downside to Evernote is the note editor is not as clean as I would like, and getting notes out of Evernote can be a pain Although many apps import from Evernote, it’s not a great experience.\n\nThen I discovered [UpNote](https://getupnote.com \"UpNote\"), a notes app similar to Bear. UpNote supports markdown and has a focus mode, making it a pleasure to write in. The sync is fast and reliable. It has plenty of features. I can organize by folder and tags. And it’s available on macOS, Windows, iOS, Android, and even Linux. I can export to various formats, including Markdown or PDF. \n\nWhat is UpNote missing? Well, on paper, it’s not missing much. In reality, a few things would make it perfect (for me). One is the ability to drag and drop notes into folders. Not a big deal. Since folders can be organized in any order, you can create sub-folders and even add colors and images to folder thumbnails, I’ll let it slide. Maybe some more explore options and better Markdown export. When I copy Markdown into other apps, sometimes I have to fix some things. \n\nThere is also something else that is missing that I can’t quite put my finger on. You may get some level of polish from apps like Bear or Ulysses. UpNote is a beautiful app, but if I were to compare the UI, Bear might be a 9 or 10, while UpNote is an 8 or 9. UpNote’s UI is beautiful but safe and not as exciting to use as other premium apps.\n\nI will stick with UpNote for a while and see if it meets my needs long-term. Let me know if you use the app yourself or know of any similar apps!\n\n",

Instead, it is about how this “Attention Crisis” impacts society.\n\nHere are some of my notes about the author’s points in this book.\n\n## What impact is this Attention Crisis having on our lives?\n- We’re finding it harder to find “Flow,” during which we become engrossed in an activity without disruptions. \n- With all the tiny bits of information continuously flowing into our lives, it becomes less likely that we’ll read books.\n- It’s harder to think because we don’t allow our minds to wonder as much as we should. Mind wandering is a critical stage in which our brain has insights, makes connections, and plans for the future.\n- Technology is becoming better at keeping us distracted. The more we look at their service, the more money the company makes, so they manipulate us to keep us engaged. \n\n## What is contributing to this Attention Crisis?\n- We’re bombarded with chemicals that harm our health and, ultimately, our attention.\n- Failing to explore ADHD. More people than ever are diagnosed with ADHD, yet we’ve prescribed medications rather than solving the causes.\n- Our children are not allowed to explore and play like in the past. They’re no longer playing in the streets and wandering the neighborhood. They’re told precisely what to do in school and what the outcome should be rather than allowing creative learning.\n- We’re not getting enough sleep due to artificial light and consumer capitalism. We’re spending too much time flipping through Tick-Tock videos rather than going to bed at a decent time and allowing our brains to recover and make connections during sleep.\n\n## How do we recover?\n- Fewer work hours to allow us more time to rest and recover.\n- Allow our children more time to play and explore, especially at school.\n- Change our technology to be less disruptive to our lives. Yet, the companies building it do not have an incentive to do so unless regulations are established, which is an entirely different issue.\n- Take it upon ourselves to control what we consume, get more sleep and exercise, and spend quality time reading and just being bored.

				"title": "The true purpose of a Zettelkasten",
				"content_html": "<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n",
				"content_text": "<p>A Zettelkasten is a German word that translates to “slip box.” The term became used to describe a particular workflow that Niklas Luhmann used to publish about 50 books and 550 articles over his career.</p><p>Many great articles are out there describing Niklas Luhmann’s Zettelkasten system. As well as a few books, so I won’t go into those details here. Instead, I want to focus on the key concepts I realized about a Zettelkasten over time.</p><p>A Zettelkasten is a box of notes. Luhmann’s workflow to take and organize notes became synonymous with Zettelkasten. When we hear the word Zettelkasten today, we think of the workflow process, not necessarily a box of index cards.</p><p>Sönke Ahrens helped make the Zettelkasten popular with his book How To Take Smart Notes. Sönke introduced the names of the various types of notes, Fleeting, Literature, Permanent, and Project, to describe the various phases of Luhmann's workflow. However, these names were never part of Luhmann’s vocabulary to describe his system (in fact, Luhmann rarely talked about his workflow). </p><p>Digital tools try to mimic the Zettelkasten workflow that Luhmann used. However, digital tools have many advantages that make some parts of his analog workflow seem wasteful, such as numbering and limiting space to what fits on a 4x6 card. We can now easily connect notes using Wiki Links, see connections using Backlinks, see a graph of notes related to the current note, and even see a visual of the entire system to identify clusters of information. Not to mention full-text search and hyperlinks!</p><p>While we can take advantage of these digital tools, we need to remember the fundamental purpose of the Zettelkasten. It’s not to make as many notes and connections as we can to grow an enormous graph that will somehow start answering all of our questions and do the writing for us.</p><div class=\"kg-card kg-callout-card kg-callout-card-blue\"><div class=\"kg-callout-text\">Luhmann’s Zettelkasten system worked because it forced him to slow down and think about each idea and how it relates to the other ideas. Numbering each card to connect it to another card was a painstaking process, which required him to spend more time organizing his notes than actually writing his publications. This gave him the time (in his head) to make real connections and insights. Digital tools can easily abstract this from us if we’re not careful.</div></div><div class=\"kg-card kg-callout-card kg-callout-card-green\"><div class=\"kg-callout-text\">Another reason Luhmann created so much content is that throughout his process, he spent time creating output that would be used in his work. Rather than capturing and making quick notes, he spent the time writing out his interpretation in his own words. When writing his publications, his thinking was already done, and he could focus on creating a draft.</div></div><h2 id=\"quotes\">Quotes</h2><blockquote>“Of course, I do not think of all this on my own; it mostly happens in my file. ... In essence, the filing system explains my productivity. ... Filing takes more of my time than writing the books” - Niklas Luhmann</blockquote><blockquote>\"What Luhmann appeared to have done instead was to immediately write his own thoughts on whatever he read in a way that would be as close to being publishable as possible. That's what allowed him to be so productive, he was constantly creating output, rather than accumulating knowledge in a way that may lead to future output, which is what most of us do when taking notes.\" (level 1, Zettelkasten is NOT a note-taking system(?))</blockquote><blockquote>\"Write all your notes and quotes on separate three-by-five-inch cards. Then, when you get ready to organize your thinking, just spread them all out on the floor, see the natural structure that emerges, and figure out what’s missing.\" (David Allen, Getting Things Done)</blockquote><h2 id=\"additional-reading\">Additional Reading</h2><ul><li><a href=\"http://luhmann.surge.sh/communicating-with-slip-boxes\">Communicating with Slip Boxes by Niklas Luhmann</a> - An article by Niklas Luhmann explains how his file system became a communication partner.</li><li><a href=\"https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/88f8/fa9dfbc0c2b296758dd932b871917c5c775a.pdf?_ga=2.255211660.501069040.1661645834-1988662615.1661645834\">Niklas Luhmann’s Card Index by Johannes Schmidt</a> - A chapter describing Niklas Luhmann’s card index in detail.</li><li><a href=\"https://amzn.to/3dRuuDW\">How to Take Smart Notes by Sönke Ahrens</a> - The book that popularized the Zettelkasten system.</li><li><a href=\"https://scottscheper.com/letter/1/\">How to Get Started Building and Antinet Zettelkasten</a> - If you’re interested in an analog Zettelkasten, Scott Scheper may describe it best.

This page syncs across devices, including my phone, so I can quickly update it throughout the day.</p><p>Using a “Working Memory” text file on your computer is nothing new. In his podcast, Cal Newport talks about it and has an <a href=\"https://www.calnewport.com/blog/2015/10/27/deep-habits-workingmemory-txt-the-most-important-productivity-tool-youve-never-heard-of/\">article</a> explaining his method.</p><p>When using only Microsoft Windows, I would use Notepad all the time for this. Now that I’m on Mac, I tried using an Apple Note or a simple document that syncs across devices. I think the biggest problem I had with them is there were too many options. I did more formatting and playing around with the note than just using it.</p><p>I only just started using Tot Pocket. So far, I like it. The sync is fast and reliable and has just enough features to allow me to jot down notes and tasks throughout the day without being distracted.</p>\n",

				"title": "Schedule time to work on projects rather than tasks",
				"content_html": "<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n",
				"content_text": "<p>We’re always told to break down our projects into next actions, which are the very next thing that must be done to move a project forward. The next actions are actionable (start with a verb). They take the guesswork out of what needs to be done.</p><p>The challenge I’ve always had has always been scheduling the appropriate time to work on these next actions. For the longest time, I would schedule my next steps in my task management app and set a date for when I need to work on it.</p><p>The problem with scheduling every task is that you constantly must go in and out of your project to see what the next action is and then set a start or due date for that task.</p><p>In the end, my task app was overwhelming, full of overdue tasks.</p><h2 id=\"plan-your-projects\">Plan your projects</h2><p>To make this work, you’ll need a list of your projects where you keep information about the project and all the known tasks for that project. Review the project as often as necessary; the Weekly Review is an excellent time for this, or even daily if the project is very active and changing.</p><p>Each project should have at 1 next action and all the other known tasks that need to be completed. The reason to do this is when you are in “Execution” mode, you want to see what’s next and start working on it. You hope to avoid doing project planning every time you open your project. The fewer decisions you must make, the more likely you will complete the task.</p><p>Your project list does not need to be anything fancy. It could be as simple as a list of subtasks in your task management app. I have a page in my notes app for each personal project that has some information about the project, some links, and then a list of tasks. My “work” projects are in the Azure DevOps Kanban board, where they are shared with my team.</p><h2 id=\"schedule-your-projects\">Schedule your projects</h2><p>If you're only using a task management app, you can set a date on your project rather than the individual tasks. They will show up in your Today list as any other task would; however, the actual tasks would be a list of subtasks or a link to your project in your other system.</p><p>Time Blocking works great for scheduling projects.</p><p>Block off time to work on a specific project. It serves the purpose of blocking your calendar, and gives you awareness to what you’ll be working on.</p><p>When planning your week, look at your project list and for each project you need to move forward this week, block an appropriate amount of time on your calendar. Not only does this give you a more realistic idea of how much time you can spend through the week, but it also blocks the time, so others can’t schedule it for you.</p><h2 id=\"exceptions\">Exceptions</h2><p>There are exceptions to everything. Not every task belongs in a project, and some tasks have to be done on specific days or times.</p><p>Go ahead and add dates and reminders to these tasks, so they show up at the appropriate time.</p><p>By only setting dates on necessary tasks, your task list is now much less overwhelming. You’ll see a list of tasks you have to do today and a list of projects you plan to work on.</p><h2 id=\"a-real-world-example\">A real-world example</h2><p>While my system is far from perfect and is always being tweaked (I can’t help myself), I’d like to share my approach and how it has helped me. You can use your preferred tools for this.</p><p>For context, I’m a Software Architect at a consulting company, and I work with a team of developers and project managers on many active projects.</p><h3 id=\"the-tools-i-use\">The tools I use</h3><ul><li>My Calendar (Google calendar for personal and Outlook for work).</li><li>iOS Reminders App where I store reminders and personal projects.</li><li>Azure DevOps Kanban Board (It's similar to Trello), where I keep project tasks. They are shared with my team. In my role, I need a clear picture of everyone else’s task for a project as well.</li><li>Paper index cards (yes, it's analog).</li></ul><h3 id=\"weekly-planning\">Weekly Planning</h3><ul><li>On Sundays, I’ll review my projects, calendar, Kanban Board, and reminders to see what needs to be done this next week.</li><li>I’ll make sure my Kanban board is up-to-date and prioritize my work.</li><li>Now that I have an idea of which projects must be worked on and how much time I require, I’ll block time on my calendar for each active project. I can see how much time I’ll have to work on projects. If It's not enough, I can let my project manager know, and we can reprioritize some things.</li><li>If there are any time specific tasks that need to be done, I add it to them, Reminders app.</li></ul><h3 id=\"daily-planning\">Daily Planning</h3><ul><li>Each day (I try to do this the night before), I’ll look at my calendar and reminders for the day and then write down on my index card the 3 most important things for me to do today. Since my day fluctuates constantly, I can still focus on those 3 things.</li><li>I’ll receive notifications from my calendar and Reminders app when it's time to switch to some other project, task, or meeting.</li><li>As things come up during the day, I’ll jot it down on my index card. I’ll even capture simple meeting notes there as well. I also jot down any ideas I have about something completely unrelated to what I’m working on.</li></ul><h3 id=\"daily-shutdown\">Daily Shutdown</h3><ul><li>At the end of each workday, I’ll review my Index card and transfer anything of importance into its appropriate home. For example, if I have a new project task, I’ll make sure to add it to Azure DevOps. If I need to schedule a call, I’ll go ahead and schedule it, or I’ll make a reminder to schedule it tomorrow.</li><li>Writing things on an index card not only lets me look away from my screen but helps prevent me from jumping in and out of my digital apps.</li></ul><h2 id=\"conclusion\">Conclusion</h2><p>I hope this encourages you to think about better ways to manage your tasks and projects. I was frustrated over the years seeing overdue items in my task list. Scheduling time to work on projects has significantly reduced the clutter and reduced the number of decisions I need to make throughout the day.</p><h2 id=\"helpful-tools\">Helpful Tools</h2><p>Here are a few related tools that I hope you find helpful.</p><ul><li><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09BDHM427/ref=cm_sw_em_r_mt_dp_E4RCPCZNQ5XGQVN3DTAB?_encoding=UTF8&psc=1\">Notsu To-Do List Card Case with 50 Cards</a></li><li><a href=\"https://ugmonk.com/\">Analog by Ugmonk</a></li><li><a href=\"https://focustivity.substack.com/p/time-blocking-and-batching-for-busy\">Time Blocking and Batching</a></li></ul>\n",

				"title": "How these Hey features changed the way I think about email",
				"content_html": "<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n",
				"content_text": "<p>The Screener, The Feed, and Paper Trail have changed my personal email experience to focus on the important and not stress about the rest.</p><p>I started using Hey last year and even wrote up my initial experiences with the unique email service. Now that it has been nearly a year of using it, I thought I would reflect on what I’m getting out of Hey that prevents me from going elsewhere.</p><p>The three main features of Hey have changed how I think about email. The Screener, The Feed, and Paper Trail.</p><blockquote>I am not compensated in any way to write this. I pay for the Hey email service out of my pocket and use it as my daily email service.</blockquote><h2 id=\"the-screener\">The Screener</h2><p>The Screener is a unique feature in Hey that prompts you to allow or decline emails from someone before it lands in your inbox. This, in combination with other elements, ensures that when you see an email in your inbox, it is important enough to warrant your attention.</p><p>I’ve used The Screener to allow emails that I want to receive (obviously) and unsubscribe to emails that I no longer want. My email is significantly cleaner because of it. Think of it as a door bouncer at a bar.</p><h2 id=\"the-feed\">The Feed</h2><p>The Feed is another unique feature of Hey email that provides a digest of all of the Newsletters, Marketing, and whatever else you want to include.</p><p>The Feed is designed to skim through quickly, and if there is something you want to read, you can click “See More…” to expand it. You don’t mark things as read. You don’t move it to an archive. You read it or don’t, and all items in your feed are deleted automatically after 90 days.</p><p>The Feed has changed the way I consume newsletters. This type of email is no longer a “Task” that I must complete; instead, they have become a feed of great content that I may want to consume when I have time.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/content/images/2022/06/0_qTx3v23K3Ry7qMWi.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt loading=\"lazy\"></figure><h2 id=\"the-paper-trail\">The Paper Trail</h2><p>The following unique feature of Hey email is The Paper Trail. You can mark emails from specific contacts to go directly to your Paper Trail. This is intended for your receipts, statements, invoices, confirmations, etc. It is the email that you need to receive but rarely reply to.</p><blockquote>I use the Paper Trail as intended. I skim through it when I have a few minutes. I can see from the email subject what it is, and 98% of the time, I have no action to take. I don’t need to interact with each email, marking it as read or archiving. I only interact with it if necessary.</blockquote><h2 id=\"take-action\">Take Action</h2><p>Do you need to use Hey email to get these features? Yes, and no. It’s a mindset change more than anything.</p><ul><li>Set up filters to move newsletters and marketing to a specific folder or label.</li><li>Get into the habit of selecting all and marking them as read. Let your filter do this for you, or ignore them. Not every email needs to be processed!</li><li>Get into the habit of reviewing each incoming email and determine if you need it. Use the Unsubscribe link at the bottom of the email to unsubscribe appropriately.</li></ul>\n",

Here are a few that I’ve discovered so far.</p><h3 id=\"setapp\">SetApp</h3><p><a href=\"https://go.setapp.com/invite/bl2jnwf8\" rel=\"noopener ugc nofollow\">Setapp</a> is a service that consolidates hundreds of Mac and iOS apps into one subscription. Setapp can save you a ton of money, depending on your apps, and it’s worth checking SetApp before purchasing any apps on the Mac. Like I did, you may find it cheaper to get a SetApp subscription that includes the apps you want and hundreds of other apps and utilities.</p><h3 id=\"raycast\">Raycast</h3><p>Mac OS has a built-in Spotlight search that triggers when you click CMD-Space. If you find Spotlight lacking, check out <a href=\"https://www.raycast.com/\" rel=\"noopener ugc nofollow\">Raycast</a>.</p><p>Raycast is a fast and extendable application launcher that does so much more. You can search anything, open anything, manage windows, and perform various other tasks that I have yet to explore.</p><p>Be sure to take the time to go through the provided walk-through. Once you realize the power of Raycast, the sky is the limit.</p><p>Alternatives include Alfred.</p><h3 id=\"1password\">1Password</h3><p>When setting up any OS, I first install 1Password, where all my passwords and other information are securely stored.</p><p>You could get by with Apple’s Keychain if you only use the Apple ecosystem. Other alternatives include LastPass and Dashlane.</p><h3 id=\"bartender\">Bartender</h3><p>Nearly every app you install on your Mac creates a menu icon in the top-right that gives you quick access to some of the functionality. Eventually, you’ll end up with a menu bar that spans the width of your monitor, which is distracting.</p><p>Bartender allows you to configure this menu, only showing the icons you want to see and hiding the rest under a menu.</p><h3 id=\"cleanmymac-x\">CleanMyMac X</h3><p>I’m constantly installing and uninstalling applications, testing to see what they do and if they help me. Unfortunately, this leaves clutter on the MAC, including files and folders and other settings that get left behind even when you uninstall.</p><p>CleanMyMac helps remove all of this unnecessary clutter from your Mac.</p><h3 id=\"bettersnaptool\">BetterSnapTool</h3><p>I have a widescreen monitor, and the biggest thing I missed from Windows is the ability to snap my windows to various positions on the screen.</p><p>BetterSnapTool does this on the Mac. You can easily position your apps and create custom areas for them to snap. Very handy!</p><p>Some alternatives are Mosaic and Magnet. I’ve begun using Raycast to manage my windows using keyboard shortcuts, which I’m enjoying.</p><h3 id=\"cleanshot-x\">CleanShot X</h3><p>CleanShot X provides some excellent screen-capture capabilities. Quickly take screenshots, annotate them, then share them.</p><h2 id=\"great-apps-exclusive-to-the-apple-ecosystem\">Great apps, exclusive to the Apple Ecosystem</h2><p>One of the biggest reasons I switched to a Mac for my setup is the great apps. It feels like apps on Windows are an afterthought and are usually only ported web applications anyway.</p><h3 id=\"things-3\">Things 3</h3><p>Things 3 is probably one of the most elegant task management applications.</p><h3 id=\"bear\">Bear</h3><p>My favorite writing and note-taking application, Bear, is a straightforward markdown-based app that lets you focus on writing. You can organize your notes using tags.</p><h3 id=\"craft\">Craft</h3><p>Craft may arguably be the best all-purpose note-taking and documentation creation app. It is simple to use and has a beautiful design, and I use it to organize my life.</p><h3 id=\"fantastical\">Fantastical</h3><p>Fantastical is an excellent calendar app that goes beyond the out-of-the-box Apple calendar. Its most prominent feature may be the autocomplete functionality, and you can type an event or task in natural language, which will set all the details for you!</p><p>I’ve only been using the Mac for a few weeks. I hope what I shared is useful. What are your favorite apps and tricks for the Mac? I’d love to learn more.</p>\n",

				"content_text": "<h2 id=\"what-is-craft\">What is Craft?</h2><p>Craft helps you build dynamic and beautiful documents from your notes, ideas, and the content you gather.</p><p>While you can easily create a new document for every note, Craft encourages the crafting of documents where you pull related information together into one place.</p><h2 id=\"who-is-craft-for\">Who is Craft for?</h2><p>Craft is a native Mac and iOS app. However, it's now available through the web (in beta), making it available on any device. It is best on iPad, Mac, and iPhones.</p><p>If a clean and beautiful UI is essential to you, Craft has that nailed. Yet, Craft has some compelling features for power users. Craft uses Markdown to handle the formatting of your content. You can import and export content in multiple formats, and it has offline support and excellent performance.</p><p>If you are a heavy writer, researcher, or enjoy making small, interconnected notes, then Craft may not be your best option. Craft can be great for casual note-taking, creating content, and exporting to other tools to prepare for publishing.</p><p>While you can easily connect notes using backlinks, you don’t get a graph overview as you do in Obsidian.</p><h2 id=\"experience\">Experience</h2><p>Craft is slightly different from what you expect from a notes application. Similar to Notion, <strong>everything you create is a block</strong>. These blocks can easily be selected and manipulated by changing the style, making it a page, or even a stylized card. On the other hand, unlike Notion, Craft doesn't feel like a database. You can't create database tables and queries.</p><p>You can write using Markdown syntax or use the Rich Text editing capabilities. If you're familiar with Markdown editors, the block editor may take some time to get used to. If you're looking for primarily a writing experience, you may be better served using a markdown editor like Bear, Ulysses, or Obsidian.</p><p>I'm not saying that the writing experience in Craft is terrible. Instead, it has been quite pleasant. It is compelling to start writing and then break down that content into child pages that you can “zoom” into. It enables you to build a complex document but quickly jump in and focus on particular pieces. The other benefit is that your main document shows in your All Documents view, not every child page, keeping things cleaner. You can still easily find any sub-page using search or Cmd-O.</p><p>The Craft iPad app takes full advantage of iOS tablet capabilities. You can have multiple tabs, multiple windows, and draft and drop into and out of Craft. Your note also comes up in Spotlight search.</p><p>Craft does not mention \"Notes\" in its interface. Instead, you create \"Documents.\" After using Craft for a while, I see why this is the case. Over time, you are crafting beautiful documents and not just simple notes. Sure, you can create a document with only a few sentences in it, but that feels like it's going against the intentions of how Craft should be used.</p><h3 id=\"import\">Import</h3><p>A common way to import content into Craft is using the Share Sheet. By default, you select an existing document to import the content into. Again, this builds on the fact that Craft is best for making documents rather than single-purpose notes. It does an impressive job at allowing you to select an existing document (or create a new one) and append or prepend the content. You can even add your text during the import.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/content/images/2022/05/Image.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt loading=\"lazy\"></figure><p>Craft also has many available Shortcuts to include Craft in your daily workflow.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/content/images/2022/05/Image-1.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt loading=\"lazy\"></figure><h3 id=\"export\">Export</h3><p>Craft shines with its export options. There are built-in sharing options for Things 3, Ulysses, Drafts, Omnifocus, iA Writer, Bear, DevonThink, Day One, and Noteplan.</p><p>But, you can also export one or all documents to Email, PDF, Markdown, Image, TextBundle, or Microsoft Word.</p><p>You can build your documents in Craft and then export them to your favorite writing tool, where you can clean them up for publishing.</p><h3 id=\"portability\">Portability</h3><p>Craft is available on macOS and iOS. You can also access your notes using the Craft Web App (currently in private beta). The web app is one of the primary reasons I started to use Craft myself. I can access my notes from anywhere, including my Windows work laptop.</p><p>I don’t see an Apple Watch app.</p><h3 id=\"sync\">Sync</h3><p>Craft's build-in sync is reliable and fast. You can see the words appear on the other device as you type. I haven’t been using Craft very long, but I’ve yet to have an issue syncing my notes.</p><h3 id=\"security\">Security</h3><p>By default, your Craft space is synced using their speedy sync service. However, you can still create your space locally on your device, in iCloud, or other third-party services.</p><p>Storing the data only on your device is the most secure option, but you’ll lose some apparent benefits. It’s excellent that Craft gives us a choice.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/content/images/2022/05/Image-2.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt loading=\"lazy\"></figure><h3 id=\"organizing-content\">Organizing Content</h3><p>Craft does not yet support <strong>tags</strong>! It will likely be introduced in a future update. <strong>Folders</strong> are the primary method for organizing content in Craft. You can create a folder hierarchy; each folder can have its icon and color.</p><p>Again, Craft is built around the idea of creating documents, not notes. Rather than making many small notes and trying to organize them using links and tags, Craft encourages the creation of documents and building out those documents to contain everything for a topic. In the end, you have fewer files with more content within those files.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/content/images/2022/05/Image-3.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt loading=\"lazy\"></figure><p>I'm using the <a href=\"https://fortelabs.co/blog/para/\">PARA</a> system to organize. I have a folder for Projects, Areas, Resources, and Archive. Within each, I have a single document per topic. When I capture something new, if I already have a document for it, Craft allows me to append it directly to the end of an existing document.</p><h3 id=\"search\">Search</h3><p>Craft has a couple of options for finding content. Cmd-O brings up a quick navigation modal, which allows you to quickly find anything based on the title or header.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/content/images/2022/05/DraggedImage.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt loading=\"lazy\"></figure><p>You can also use a traditional search to find anything, including cards and pages created within your documents.</p><h3 id=\"daily-notes\">Daily Notes</h3><p>Craft also has a dedicated section for Daily Notes. You can connect your iOS calendar to see events and click on them to create meeting notes. You have access to the same features, including links, backlinks, cards, etc.</p><p>This is an excellent option for capturing notes that do not belong in a specific document throughout the day. You can also keep meeting notes here and link them to project documents, which is quite handy.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/content/images/2022/05/Image-4.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt loading=\"lazy\"></figure><h2 id=\"pricing\">Pricing</h2><p>Craft is free for 1000 blocks, which is plenty to try. If you decide to use Craft long-term, it is currently $44.99 per year.</p><blockquote>If you are not paying for a product, you are the product.</blockquote><h2 id=\"conclusion\">Conclusion</h2><p>I have not been using Craft very long. I wanted to try it out and share my thoughts with you. I’ve come to enjoy curating documents for the various areas of my life and projects. The beautiful UI, formatting options, Markdown support, the ability to easily import and export, and the web app have convinced me to stick with Craft.</p><h2 id=\"resources\">Resources</h2><p><a href=\"https://www.craft.do/\">Craft | A fresh take on documents</a></p><p><a href=\"https://www.craft.do/pricing\">Craft – Pricing</a></p><p><a href=\"https://craft-developer-portal.webflow.io/\">Craft Developer Platform</a></p><p><a href=\"https://www.craft.do/whats-new\">What's new</a></p><p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/craftdocsapp?s=11\">Craft.do (@craftdocsapp)</a></p>\n",

It is thin and light, and the all-aluminum body gives it a nice solid feel. It is like holding a slate, and a solid strip on the left side gives it a nice look.</p><p>The material is the same on both sides. The back has four rubber nubs to keep the device from sliding around on a solid surface. The right side of the device has a magnet so you can attach the Marker.</p><p>The battery life seems excellent. I have not had the device long enough to say exactly how long it will last. So far, I've had the tablet for six days and only charged it once, and it was at about 70% charge when I received it. reMarkable says \"weeks of battery,\" but I suppose that depends on how much you use the device. I probably have it turned on for several hours per day.</p><p>It's hard to complain about anything on the hardware itself. If anything, the screen margins are pretty thick, especially at the bottom. It's hard to notice until you are writing and start to run out of space on the page.</p><blockquote>Tip: You’ll need an external light source to see the screen. Don’t expect to read in the dark!</blockquote><p>The other thing to note is that this device has no backlight. No backlight means you need an external light source to be able to see the screen.</p><h3 id=\"technical-specifications\">Technical Specifications</h3><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/81720/2022/e0edfb42b4.jpg\" class=\"kg-image\" alt loading=\"lazy\" width=\"888\" height=\"911\" srcset=\"__GHOST_URL__/content/images/size/w600/2022/09/The-reMarkable-2-Technical-Specifications.png 600w, https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/81720/2022/e0edfb42b4.jpg 888w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 720px) 720px\"></figure><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/81720/2022/c8d7727c70.jpg\" class=\"kg-image\" alt loading=\"lazy\" width=\"640\" height=\"480\" srcset=\"__GHOST_URL__/content/images/size/w600/2022/09/The-reMarkable-2-Marker-Plus.jpeg 600w, https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/81720/2022/c8d7727c70.jpg 640w\"></figure><p>You can get either the regular Marker or the Marker plus. The Marker is white and has no buttons or eraser, and I have not used one, so people say it feels nice and has a nice texture based on my research.</p><p>The Marker Plus is what I have, and the primary differences are that 1) It's black, and 2) it comes with an eraser. The texture is excellent, and it has a nice weight to it. One side is flat, which serves two purposes, 1) to keep it from rolling off your desk, and 2. to magnetically attach to the device. I have had no problems writing with it. I also don't feel like it will easily detach from the device unless you're tossing it in a bag.</p><blockquote>Is it worth the extra $50 for the Marker Plus if all it includes is an eraser? I feel like it is. If you are like me and always messing up, it is simple to flip the Marker over and quickly erase it. It seems to save a lot of time.</blockquote><p>Neither of the Markers needs to be charged.</p><p>The biggest downside of the Marker is the tips. The tips are replaceable because they wear down. I have not had mine long enough to know how long they last for me. Based on my research, it could be every week to every six weeks. The reMarkable comes with nine extra tips and a way to replace them. The Marker Tips currently cost $14 for a replacement pack.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/81720/2022/6983606655.jpg\" class=\"kg-image\" alt loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1000\" height=\"1333\" srcset=\"__GHOST_URL__/content/images/size/w600/2022/09/The-reMarkable-2-Tips.jpeg 600w, https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/81720/2022/6983606655.jpg 1000w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 720px) 720px\"></figure><blockquote>Tip (pun intended): Don’t forget about the tips. It can be easy to miss them in the packaging. You’ll want to set them aside where you can find them again.</blockquote><h3 id=\"the-book-folio\">The Book Folio</h3><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/81720/2022/f0bb9070d1.jpg\" class=\"kg-image\" alt loading=\"lazy\" width=\"640\" height=\"480\" srcset=\"__GHOST_URL__/content/images/size/w600/2022/09/The-reMarkable-2-Grey-Folio.jpeg 600w, https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/81720/2022/f0bb9070d1.jpg 640w\"></figure><p>I opted for the Gray Book Folio (Polymer Weave). It is very thin and covers the device nicely. Removing the reMarkable from the cover is effortless, yet it stays in place firmly.</p><p>The material is acceptable — nothing to get excited over. It doesn't feel like it is worth $99. But it's cheaper than the $149 leather Book Folio (which I hear doesn't feel like natural leather). It's probably worth getting just because it helps protect your investment.</p><h2 id=\"first-impressions-of-the-software\">First Impressions of the Software</h2><blockquote>I was running version 2.5.0.27 when I wrote this. Since there have been drastic software improvements!</blockquote><p>I had no problems figuring out how to use the software. It is very straightforward. Your main screen consists of your folders and files. Across the top are options to open the menu, create a folder, create a notebook, access Quick Sheets, or search. You can see the battery life, Wi-Fi connection, and sync status across the bottom of the main screen.</p><blockquote>Tip: Talking about distraction-free, it doesn’t even have a clock!</blockquote><p>I'm not going to go into details about the software interface; I think it works well and is pretty smooth. It would be best to remember that this is an e-ink device, and the pages refresh differs from a typical tablet. I feel like the refresh is faster than my Kindle Paperwhite, and I have not had any issues with the performance.</p><p>Sometimes the swipe event does not register, and I have to swipe multiple times to get it to swap between pages or close a notebook. It is not an issue if you swipe in the right place and with enough motion.</p><blockquote>Tip: You can close any notebook or PDF you are on by swiping down from the top of the screen. Much faster than trying to use the menu.</blockquote><h3 id=\"layers\">Layers</h3><p>You can create Layers on your page, allowing you to manipulate one layer without affecting the other layers. You can make more elaborate sketches and diagrams or add text over a custom background.</p><h3 id=\"text\">Text</h3><p>Another cool feature is the ability to convert your handwriting to text. This feature works as well as can be expected. Your writing must be clear enough for it to recognize the words. It appears you can only convert one or more pages to text. Once the conversion is complete, you have no choice but to email it somewhere. You can't save the converted text to the device.</p><blockquote>Tip: You need to be connected to Wi-Fi to do any text conversion.</blockquote><h3 id=\"templates\">Templates</h3><p>The device comes with many built-in templates that you can use. The built-in templates include everything from dots to your standard notebook lines with margins.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/81720/2022/f9b87bc5bb.jpg\" class=\"kg-image\" alt loading=\"lazy\" width=\"640\" height=\"480\" srcset=\"__GHOST_URL__/content/images/size/w600/2022/09/The-reMarkable-2-Templates.jpeg 600w, https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/81720/2022/f9b87bc5bb.jpg 640w\"></figure><p>I immediately found myself not finding the templates that I wanted to use. Fortunately, you can add your custom templates with a bit of know-how. You can look at some of the additional resources I have at the bottom of this article for more information.</p><p>Fortunately, you can also use a PDF for your Daily Planner type of notebook. You can find them all over the place, and Etsy is an excellent place to start. I added some more resources to the bottom of this article.</p><h3 id=\"sharing\">Sharing</h3><p>You can share pages or entire notebooks or PDFs from the device. You'll be prompted to enter an email address or select an email you already used. You can add a message, change the filename, and select an export format (PDF, PNG, or SVG). The feature works well enough.</p><blockquote>Tip: Of course, you can always download the PDF on your desktop and do what you want with it from there.</blockquote><h3 id=\"search\">Search</h3><p>You can easily search for any notebook, PDF, or Epub on your device from the search icon. You will also see all of the most recently updated files on your device, making it easy to switch back and forth.</p><blockquote>Unfortunately, your notes and files’ content is not searched — only the file names and folders.</blockquote><h3 id=\"cloud-sync\">Cloud Sync</h3><p>While using the reMarkable Cloud Sync is not required, it is hard to avoid. The advantage to using Cloud Sync is that your content is automatically backed up to the cloud and available on your other devices.</p><p>The Cloud Sync works okay and is not instantaneous (most of the time), but it seems to get the job done.</p><h3 id=\"the-read-on-remarkable-browser-extension\">The \"Read on reMarkable\" Browser Extension</h3><p>There is a new Browser extension from the Remarkable team called <a href=\"https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/read-on-remarkable/bfhkfdnddlhfippjbflipboognpdpoeh\">Read on reMarkable</a>.\" This extension allows you to send nearly any webpage to your device with a single click. You have two options. The default is to send the page to the device in Epub format. This method looks excellent but does not include the source or any images! So I switched my default to PDF. The page is converted to PDF with this setting and sent directly to your device. The PDF option includes images and more information about the article.</p><p>How the content looks on the device is hit or miss. It depends on the source content. If the page is full of ads and poorly formatted, it will be of low quality on the device. I've found that sites with a clean format look great on the device.</p><blockquote>Tip: Use the PDF format if you want to include images and the source for your articles.</blockquote><h3 id=\"desktop-and-mobile\">Desktop and Mobile</h3><p>Speaking of Cloud Sync, you can access your content from your desktop or mobile devices. The desktop and mobile software is nothing spectacular; it merely shows you your content, just as you would see on your device. You can then read, rearrange, or export your content as needed.</p><h3 id=\"jagged-line-issue\">Jagged Line Issue</h3><blockquote>Tip: This could be a deal-breaker for some. I don’t feel like it is an issue, as I don’t notice it unless I’m looking for it.</blockquote><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/81720/2022/998c4acb66.jpg\" class=\"kg-image\" alt loading=\"lazy\" width=\"640\" height=\"480\" srcset=\"__GHOST_URL__/content/images/size/w600/2022/09/The-reMarkable-2-Jagged-Lines.jpeg 600w, https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/81720/2022/998c4acb66.jpg 640w\"></figure><blockquote>Updated March 27, 2021: The reMarkable team released version 2.6, which addresses this issue.</blockquote><p>The \"Jagged Line Issue\" is one of the annoying things I found about Remarkable 2. If you look very closely at the writing (zoom in if it helps), you can see the lines are not smooth and jagged, depending on how you write. You can see a very (extremely detailed) video that explains the issue here.</p><h2 id=\"the-writing-experience\">The Writing Experience</h2><p>Okay, I suppose you want to know how this table feels when writing.</p><blockquote>It feels remarkable, like writing on paper!</blockquote><p>One of the things I enjoy when writing on paper is how distraction-free it is, and the \"feeling\" of writing helps me slow down and think. I get the same feeling while writing on the Remarkable. In addition to that, I can easily erase, move things around, convert to text, and search.</p><p>My writing is better when using the reMarkable. I tend to write very small on paper, while on the reMarkable, I have more space and write larger and, therefore, more legibly.</p><p>The latency is about 21ms, which is maybe the best in the market. There is very little noticeable lag when writing.</p><h2 id=\"the-reading-experience\">The Reading Experience</h2><p>I have limited experience with the reading functionality on the device. But here is what I have discovered so far.</p><h3 id=\"pdf\">PDF</h3><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/81720/2022/11cc44f905.jpg\" class=\"kg-image\" alt loading=\"lazy\" width=\"640\" height=\"480\" srcset=\"__GHOST_URL__/content/images/size/w600/2022/09/The-remarkable-2-PDF.jpeg 600w, https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/81720/2022/11cc44f905.jpg 640w\"></figure><p>In general, PDFs look great on the reMarkable 2. My only complaint is that the device is slightly too small to read most PDFs comfortably. Articles converted to PDF seem to work well.</p><blockquote><code>Adjust the view</code></blockquote><h3 id=\"epub\">EPUB</h3><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/81720/2022/424cb65fa8.jpg\" class=\"kg-image\" alt loading=\"lazy\" width=\"480\" height=\"640\"></figure><p>I have heard that the reMarkable doesn't work well with EPUB, and I don't have enough experience with them yet to know for sure. I have one EPUB I added to the device, <a href=\"https://gumroad.com/l/doing-content-right\">Doing Content Right, by Steph Smith</a>. It looks great! I've had no problems, and it has been much easier to read than the PDF version.</p><blockquote>Tip: You will not be able to read your Kindle books on this device.</blockquote><h2 id=\"the-price\">The Price</h2><ul><li>The reMarkable itself is $399.</li><li>The Marker is $49. The Marker Plus is $99.</li><li>The Folios start at $69 and go up to $149.</li></ul><p>My setup, the reMarkable with the Marker Plus and Book Folio, came to $597 before tax. Ouch!</p><blockquote>Tip: Yes, you see that correctly. The reMarkable writing device does not include a Marker, which is ridiculous!</blockquote><h2 id=\"what-would-make-the-remarkable-2-better\">What would make the reMarkable 2 better?</h2><ul><li>Fix the Jagged lines issue. (reMarkable fixed the Jagged Lines issue in version 2.6)</li><li>Include the content, even your handwritten notes, in search results.</li><li>Faster sync.</li><li>More Text Conversion options.</li><li>Provide better formatting for both PDF and EPUB.</li><li>Better support. I have not needed to contact the reMarkable support team, but I have not heard great things regarding response times.</li><li>Provide more support for accessing your content without using Cloud Sync.</li></ul><p>I think it is worth purchasing a reMarkable 2 if you like to write and if you like to use paper for organizing your day. It is excellent to take meeting notes, write out thoughts, draft articles, make sketches and diagrams, disconnect from the world, and get lost in your thoughts.</p><p>While I love the reMarkable 2 and use it daily as part of my workflow, it is not a perfect device. The good news is that, in theory, software updates could resolve some of the existing problems.</p><p>If you're looking for a distraction-free digital writing device, I highly recommend it.</p>\n",

(Sönke Ahrens, How to Take Smart Notes)</blockquote><p>Zettelkasten is a German word for “slip box.” Made famous by Niklas Luhmann (1927–1998), a Zettelkasten is a tool for thinking and writing. It was initially an analog system for taking notes using index cards and wooden boxes. Some people still prefer the analog approach, yet modern digital tools make a Zettelkasten much less complicated and arguably more powerful.</p><h2 id=\"niklas-luhmann\">Niklas Luhmann</h2><p>Niklas Luhmann (1927–1998) was a German sociologist who was highly productive. He wrote over 70 books and nearly 400 scholarly articles on a variety of topics.</p><p>The key to Luhmann’s success was not his ability to sit down on a blank sheet and write a book; instead, it was all about his note-taking system. He developed a simple method to take notes using index cards. His approach was called a Zettelkasten or Slip-Box.</p><p>Throughout the day, he would write his Fleeting Notes and Literature Notes in a notebook. Then at night, he takes those ideas and converts them into Permanent Notes on his index cards.</p><p>To keep the notes connected and discoverable, Luhmann devised a numbering system. He would give each card a unique number, which allowed cards to be referenced by other cards. In today’s digital world, this could resemble hyperlinks.</p><p>Instead of adding a new card to the end of the stack, he would determine if it was related to any previously existing note. He would then add the new card behind the related note and assign it a unique number. For example, if he put the new card behind an existing card that was numbered 57/12, the new card would be numbered 57/13. The next related card would have the number 57/13a. And so on.</p><h2 id=\"types-of-notes\">Types of Notes</h2><p>There are several types of notes in a Zettelkasten system, including Fleeting Notes, Literature Notes, Permanent Notes, and Project Notes.</p><h3 id=\"fleeting-notes\">Fleeting Notes</h3><p>Fleeting Notes are temporary. The primary purpose is to quickly capture ideas, thoughts, feelings, things to do, or anything else that comes to mind that you may want to refer back to at a later time.</p><p>These notes should be processed as quickly as possible, typically within a few days, before losing meaning.</p><p>They are written in a way that provides just enough information to relay their meaning. It does not need to be grammatically correct. Use abbreviations, shorthand, or whatever you need to capture the information quickly. Even a picture can work at times.</p><p>When the note is reviewed, it can either be immediately discarded if it has no more relevance. If worth keeping, create a Permanent Note, then throw the Fleeting Note away. You no longer need it.</p><h3 id=\"literature-notes\">Literature Notes</h3><p>Literature Notes are taken while reading or consuming content from videos, podcasts, or other media. They are more formal than Fleeting Notes but not as formal as Permanent Notes. Short and to the point.</p><p>Literature notes are written in your own words. They are your tool for ensuring you understand the concept. Therefore, copy-and-paste will do you no good.</p><p>Keep the bibliographic details together with your Literature Notes so that you can quickly get back to the source if you need to review the content again.</p><p>It can help write your Literature Notes on paper, forcing you to write in your own words and minimize digital distractions. Also, writing can help you slow down, think, and can even help you remember better.</p><h3 id=\"permanent-notes\">Permanent Notes</h3><p>Permanent Notes are what form your knowledge base. They are written entirely in your own words and express your understanding and opinions of a single specific topic.</p><p>Use your Literature Notes to form the ideas that go into your Permanent notes. The note itself should be about a single topic. It is atomic. It is written in a way that anyone, including your future self, can understand its meaning.</p><p>Your collection of Permanent Notes will be your archive that you can pull from at any time. After accumulating enough notes about a topic, you will find that if you want to write something about that topic, it is as simple as pulling up your ready-to-go Permanent Notes and organizing them into a draft.</p><p>Using Bi-Directional Links within your Permanent Notes is an easy way to link your thoughts. You can also use tags.</p><p>Keep your references with your note so you can always find the source(s) where you found the ideas.</p><h3 id=\"project-notes\">Project Notes</h3><p>Project Notes are for a specific project. They include meeting notes, checklists, and miscellaneous notes. Once the project is complete, you will archive them with the project.</p><p>Project Notes generally do not contribute to your overall PKM (Personal Knowledge Management). If you have notes that can help multiple projects, convert them into more generic Permanent Notes instead.</p><h2 id=\"core-principles-of-a-zettelkasten\">Core Principles of a Zettelkasten</h2><p>The following are what I consider the core principles of a Zettelkasten.</p><h3 id=\"create-one-note-per-idea\">Create one note per idea</h3><p>Creating one note per idea applies to the Permanent Notes, which I’ll talk more about below. Creating one note for each idea allows the most flexibility. You can then use that one note with other related notes in more ways than you realize. Imagine using index cards for your notes. You can take all of your notes and spread them out on the table. Then you can easily rearrange them, making connections between those notes. You can do the same thing in the digital format; however, your notes need to be atomic to accomplish this.</p><h3 id=\"give-each-note-a-unique-id\">Give each note a unique ID</h3><p>When using digital tools, just a unique Title will suffice.</p><h3 id=\"write-your-notes-in-your-own-words\">Write your notes in your own words</h3><p>Doing so helps ensure you understand what you’re consuming. If you can’t write it in your own words, you likely don’t understand it.</p><h3 id=\"include-context-with-your-notes\">Include context with your notes</h3><p>Write your notes so that anyone, including your future self, can understand them. This is especially helpful if you want to share a specific idea or even combine ideas into an article (like this one).</p><h3 id=\"connect-your-notes\">Connect your notes</h3><p>The analog method would require you to generate unique identifiers for each note. Digital tools make this much simpler by creating bi-directional links.</p><h3 id=\"keep-the-organization-of-your-notes-simple\">Keep the organization of your notes simple</h3><p>My personal preference is to capture Fleeting Notes and Literature Notes on paper. I then write my Permanent Notes in Obsidian all in one folder.</p><p>Suppose you keep all of your notes in one application. In that case, an option is to create a folder for each type of note (Fleeting, Literature, Permanent, Project) and store all of your notes in the appropriate folder without any other subfolders.</p><p>When organizing into a hierarchy, we often spend more time than necessary managing our notes rather than creating them.</p><p>Let the links and tags in your notes create the hierarchy naturally!</p><h2 id=\"digital-zettelkasten-applications\">Digital Zettelkasten applications</h2><p>There is a wide variety of applications that can be used for a digital Zettelkasten. You could use familiar applications like Evernote, Bear, Apple Notes, and OneNote. Still, they lack specific functionality, like bi-directional links, that would take your digital Zettelkasten to the next level.</p><p>Several applications are built specifically for a Zettelkasten. These include The Archive and Zettlr, Roam Research, Obsidian, Notion, RemNote, TiddlyWiki, and Amplenote,</p><h2 id=\"conclusion\">Conclusion</h2><p>I hope this helped explain what a Zettelkasten is and gives you some ideas for using one for your note-taking system. Everyone has different methods that work best for them. I recommend checking out some of the communities where you can find more information and have discussions with others. The Zettelkasten Forum, Obsidian Forum, and Zettelkasten Subreddit are great places to start.</p><h2 id=\"references\">References</h2><p>Ahrens, Sönke.
